<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Giving the dates &amp;c. of important Sanskrit writers.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">आर्यभदृ¦ A well-known astronomer. Born A. D. 476.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">उद्भट¦ One of the earliest writers on Alankâra. He</div>
<div class="line">was the chief Pandit or Sabhâpati of king Ja-</div>
<div class="line">yâpîda of Kâshmir (779-813 A. D.).</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">कय्यट¦ Author of the भाष्यप्रदीप, being a commen-</div>
<div class="line">tary on Patanjali’s महाभाष्य। He is considered by</div>
<div class="line">Dr. Buhler to be not older than the 13th century.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">कल्हण¦ The author of the well-known राजतरंगिणी ‘the</div>
<div class="line">chronicle of kings’. He was a contemporay of Jaya-</div>
<div class="line">simha of Kâshmir who reigned from 1129-1150</div>
<div class="line">A. D.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">कालिदास¦ The celebrated author of the अभिज्ञानशकुंतल,</div>
<div class="line">विक्रमोर्वशीय, मालविकाग्निमित्र, रघुवंश, कुमारसंभव, मेघदूत, ऋतु-</div>
<div class="line">संहार; also of the poems नलोदय and of some other</div>
<div class="line">minor works. The earliest known authentic refer-</div>
<div class="line">ence to Kâlidâsa is in an inscription dated 556</div>
<div class="line"><em>S</em>ake or 634 A. D., in which he and Bhâravi</div>
<div class="line">are spoken of as being renowned poets. The verse</div>
<div class="line">is as follows:–</div>
<div class="line">येनायोजि न वेश्म</div>
<div class="line">स्थिरमर्थविधौ विवेकिना जिनवेश्म ।</div>
<div class="line">स विजयतां रविकीर्तिः</div>
<div class="line">कविताश्रितकालिदासभारविकीर्तिः ॥</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Bâṇa’s reference to him in the beginning of his</div>
<div class="line">Harsha-charita also shows that he must have flou-</div>
<div class="line">rished before the time of Bâṇa, <em>i. e.</em> before the</div>
<div class="line">first half of the seventh century. But how long</div>
<div class="line">before the seventh century the poet flourished</div>
<div class="line">is not yet known. According to Mallinâtha’s ex-</div>
<div class="line">planation on Me. 14 निचुल and दिङ्नाग were con-</div>
<div class="line">temporaries of Kâlidâsa. If Mallinatha’s sug-</div>
<div class="line">gestion be correct-and it is very doubtful if it be</div>
<div class="line">really so-then our poet must have lived in the</div>
<div class="line">middle of the sixth century which is the date</div>
<div class="line">usually assigned to दिङ्नाग।</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">There is one point which, if definitely settled,</div>
<div class="line">would give the poet’s precise date. It is the</div>
<div class="line">mention by Kâlidâsa of his patron Vikrama.</div>
<div class="line">Who this Vikrama is it has not yet been definite-</div>
<div class="line">ly settled. Popular tradition identifies him with</div>
<div class="line">the founder of the Samvat Era which is said to</div>
<div class="line">have commenced 56 B. C. If this view be cor-</div>
<div class="line">rect, Kâlidâsa must be considered as belonging</div>
<div class="line">to the first century before Christ. But some</div>
<div class="line">scholars have recently come to the conclusion</div>
<div class="line">that what is called the era of Vikramâditya</div>
<div class="line">56. B C. was a date arrived at by taking the date</div>
<div class="line">of the great battle of Korūr in which Vikrama</div>
<div class="line">finally defeated the Mlechch has, <em>i. e.</em> 544 A. D,</div>
<div class="line">and then by throwing back the beginning of the</div>
<div class="line">new era 600 years before that date, <em>i. e.</em> 56 B.</div>
<div class="line">C. If this conclusion be accepted as correct-and</div>
<div class="line">scholars do not seem to have yet agreed on the</div>
<div class="line">point-Kâlidâsa must have flourished in the sixth</div>
<div class="line">century A. D. The question is still an open one.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">क्षेमेंद्र¦ A well-known poet of Kâshmir, author of</div>
<div class="line">समयमातृका and several other works. He flourished</div>
<div class="line">during the second and the third quarter of the</div>
<div class="line">11th century.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">जगद्धर¦ N. of a celebrated commentator, who has</div>
<div class="line">written commentaries on the Mâlatî-Mâdava and</div>
<div class="line">Veṇi4-Samhâra. He lived after the 14th century.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">जगन्नाथपंडित¦ N. of a celebrated modern author.</div>
<div class="line">His most celebrated work is the रसगंगाधर a trea-</div>
<div class="line">tise on Rhetoric or Poetics; his other works</div>
<div class="line">are भामिनीविलास, the five <em>laharis</em> (गंगा, पयूष, सुधा,</div>
<div class="line">अमृत, करुणा), and a few minor works. He is</div>
<div class="line">supposed to have flourished during the time of</div>
<div class="line">the Emperor Shah Jahan of Delhi. He must</div>
<div class="line">have also seen the latter end of Jehangir’s reign,</div>
<div class="line">and the temporary accession of Dârâ to the</div>
<div class="line">throne in 1658. His date, –at least, his active</div>
<div class="line">career-lay, therefore, between 1620 and 1660 A. D.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">जयदेव¦ Author of that charming lyric poem the</div>
<div class="line">Gîtagovinda. He was an inhabitant of the village</div>
<div class="line">Kinduwilva in the Vîrabhūmi district of Bengal. He</div>
<div class="line">is said to have lived in the time of a king called</div>
<div class="line">Lakshmaṇasena who is identified by Dr. Buhler</div>
<div class="line">with the Vaidya king of Bengal whose inscription</div>
<div class="line">is dated Vikrama Samvat 1173 or 1116 A. D. The</div>
<div class="line">poet must have, therefore, flourished in the 12th</div>
<div class="line">century.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">दंडिन्¦ Author of the Da<em>s</em>akumâracharita and Kâvyâ-</div>
<div class="line">dar<em>s</em>a. He flourished in the latter half of the sixth</div>
<div class="line">century, and was a contemporary of Bâṇa, accord-</div>
<div class="line">ing to Mâdhavâchàrya.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">पतंजलि¦ The celebrated author of the Mahâbhâshyat.</div>
<div class="line">He is said to have lived about 150 B. C.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">नारायण (भट्टनारायण)¦ Author of the Veṇî-Samhâra.</div>
<div class="line">He must have flourished before the 9th century as</div>
<div class="line">his work is frequently quoted by the poet Ananda-</div>
<div class="line">vardhana in his work called ध्यन्यालोक। This poet</div>
<div class="line">flourished under the reign of Avantivarman 855-</div>
<div class="line">884 A. D. (Râj. T. 5. 34)</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">बाण¦ The well-known author of the Harshacharita,</div>
<div class="line">Kâdambarî and Chaṇḍikâ<em>s</em>ataka. Pârvatîpariṇaya</div>
<div class="line">and Ratnâvalî are also ascribed to him. His date</div>
<div class="line">is indisputably fixed by that of his patron Harsha-</div>
<div class="line">vardhana of Kânyakubja who was reigning during</div>
<div class="line">the whole of Hiouen Thsang’s travels in India</div>
<div class="line">which lasted from 629 to 645 A. D. Bâṇa must,</div>
<div class="line">therefore, have lived in the latter half of the sixth</div>
<div class="line">or the first half of the seventh century. The date</div>
<div class="line">of Bâṇa is useful in ascertaining the dates-at least</div>
<div class="line">the <em>termini ad quem</em> –of several writers mentioned</div>
<div class="line">by him in his introduction to the Harsha Charita.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">बिल्हण¦ Author of the Mahâkàvya Vikramânkadevacha-</div>
<div class="line">rita and of Chaurapanchá<em>s</em>ikâ. He flourished in</div>
<div class="line">the latter half of the 11th century.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">भट्टि¦ A son of <em>S</em>rî Svâmin, who lived in Vallabhi</div>
<div class="line">during the reign of king <em>S</em>ridharasena or of Nar-</div>
<div class="line">endra, the son of Srîdhara, who is supposed by</div>
<div class="line">Lassen to have reigned from 530 to 545 A. D.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">भर्तृहरि¦ Author of the three <em>S</em>atakas and of the Vâkya-</div>
<div class="line">padîya. Mr. Telang gives it as his opinion that</div>
<div class="line">he must have flourished about the close of the</div>
<div class="line">first and the beginning of the second century of</div>
<div class="line">the Christian era. Tradition makes him brother of</div>
<div class="line">king Vikrama, and if this Vikrama be accepted</div>
<div class="line">as the same who defeated the Mlechchhas in 544</div>
<div class="line">A. D., we must suppose Bhartṛihari to have flourish-</div>
<div class="line">ed in the latter half of the sixth century.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">भवभूति¦ The well-known author of the Mahâvīracharita,</div>
<div class="line">Mâlatî Mâdhava, and Uttararâmacharita. He was</div>

<div class="line">Ya<em>s</em>ovarman of Kânyakubja, who was subdued by</div>
<div class="line">Lalitâditya of Kâshmir (693-729 A. D.) Bhava-</div>
<div class="line">bhūti flcurished therefore at the end of the 7th</div>
<div class="line">century, and this date is consistent with Bâṇa’s</div>
<div class="line">omission of his name. All anecdotes about the</div>
<div class="line">contemporaneity of Kâlidâsa and Bhavabhūti must</div>
<div class="line">be rejected as absolute myths.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">भारवि¦ Author of the Kirátàrjunîya; mentioned along</div>
<div class="line">with Kâlidâsa in an inscription dated 634. See</div>

<div class="line">the poet Ratnâkara (who flourished in the 9th</div>

<div class="line">be placed before the 9th century.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">रत्नाकर¦ Author of the Mahâkâvya called Haravijaya</div>
