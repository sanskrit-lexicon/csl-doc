<div class="line">In preparing this edition, extreme care has been taken to</div>
<div class="line">make a thorough revision of the book, the main features of</div>
<div class="line">which are:–</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">(a) Over a thousand new words frequently occurring in</div>
<div class="line">the English literature but not given in the previous editions</div>
<div class="line">have now been added with their appropriate Sanskrit</div>
<div class="line">equivalents.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">(b) In some cases, Sanskrit equivalents of words in senses</div>
<div class="line">other than those given in the earlier editions have been supplied.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">(c) Words similar in form but different in sense, and also</div>
<div class="line">their derivatives were mixed up in the earlier editions to save</div>
<div class="line">space. But as this was found to interfere greatly with clear-</div>
<div class="line">ness and facility of reference they have now been separately</div>
<div class="line">given in some cases to remedy the inconvenience.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">(d) The feminine forms of adjectives ending in त्, न्, and</div>
<div class="line">स् which are regularly formed by the simple addition of ई were</div>
<div class="line">given in the previous editions in the case of the first three</div>
<div class="line">letters, and then discontinued. They have now been deleted</div>
<div class="line">throughout.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In making these changes, the original plan of the learned</div>
<div class="line">author has been strictly followed.</div>

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">These additions and alterations will be found to have con-</div>

<h1>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION<a class="headerlink" href="#preface-to-the-first-edition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">When I prepared “The Student’s Hand-Book of Progressive</div>
<div class="line">Exercises,” Part II., I thought of adding to it a glossary of</div>
<div class="line">difficult words and expressions in the Exercises. When this</div>
<div class="line">was done, an idea occurred that the Glossary should be made</div>
<div class="line">to include all words of ordinary occurrence, such as are given</div>
<div class="line">in small School-Dictionaries. When the revision of the sheets</div>
<div class="line">thus written out commenced, and when they were put to a</div>
<div class="line">practical test, it was found that several words and expressions</div>
<div class="line">had still been left out. I, then, resolved to prepare an English-</div>
<div class="line">Sanskrit Dictionary as complete as possible, and the following</div>
<div class="line">pages are the result. The Dictionary has thus passed through</div>
<div class="line">different stages, and has assumed this form, far exceeding the</div>
<div class="line">limits which I had first assigned to it.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Much need not, I think, be said with regard to the necessity</div>
<div class="line">of a work like this. In these days of literary activity, when</div>
<div class="line">the attention of students is drawn more and more to the study</div>
<div class="line">of Sanskrit, it is necessary that all appliances should be ready</div>
<div class="line">before them to facilitate this study. There are one or two</div>
<div class="line">small Sanskrit-English Dictionaries, though not quite adequate</div>
<div class="line">to meet the wants of advanced students of Sanskrit, but there</div>
<div class="line">is no English-Sanskrit Dictionary such as will be within their</div>
<div class="line">easy reach. The Dictionaries of this description that I know</div>
<div class="line">of, are two in number:-one by Professor Monier Williams, and</div>
<div class="line">another by Mr. Anundoram Borooah of Calcutta. Both these</div>
<div class="line">Dictionaries, though valuable in themselves, are not accesible</div>
<div class="line">to the student, the prices being prohibitively high. But there</div>
<div class="line">are other considerations which make these works not quite</div>
<div class="line">adapted to his wants. Professor Monier Williams’ Dictionary,</div>
<div class="line">having been compiled nearly 35 years ago, chiefly by inverting</div>
<div class="line">the then existing Sanskrit-English Dictionaries, is naturally</div>
<div class="line">open to the fault of being often not <em>practical.</em> As he says in</div>
<div class="line">the Preface to his Dictionary, he proceeded to translate</div>
<div class="line">Webster’s Dictionary systematically into Sanskrit, omitting</div>
<div class="line">words, phrases &amp;c. of which no classical equivalent could be</div>
<div class="line">found or suggested. The result has been that many of his</div>
<div class="line">synonyms appear more as coined words than classical expres-</div>
<div class="line">sions used by standard Sanskrit authors. With regard to words</div>
<div class="line">collected in Lexicons, such as Amarakosha, Medini, Sabdakal-</div>
<div class="line">padruma, there is no difficulty; but in the case of those words</div>
<div class="line">and expressions which can only be suggested by a careful study</div>
<div class="line">of the usage of the best authors, the work, in my humble opin-</div>
<div class="line">ion, falls short of one’s expectations. Mr. Anundoram Borooah’s</div>
<div class="line">work is eminently <em>practical:</em> it abounds with quotations from</div>
<div class="line">several standard authors; the renderings are generally happy,</div>
<div class="line">and the work has, at least, a classical appearance. The</div>
<div class="line">fondness for giving quotations has induced the writer to give</div>
<div class="line">several quotations for illustrating such words as गम, इति, तत्र, वद</div>
<div class="line">&amp;c., of the meanings of which there is no doubt nor is any</div>
<div class="line">confirmation needed. But one great defect of his otherwise</div>
<div class="line">very useful work is that it gives too few equivalents. He has</div>
<div class="line">pursued the course of referring one word to another, but</div>
<div class="line">this is, in some cases, carried to such an extent, that</div>
<div class="line">when a word, as directed, is referred to another, that</div>
<div class="line">again is referred to some other word of a synonymous</div>
<div class="line">nature, which in its turn is referred to another till the</div>
<div class="line">reader returns to the original word, apparently without</div>
<div class="line">having his labours rewarded. A study of Mr. Borooah’s work</div>
<div class="line">is a good treat for an advanced Sanskrit scholar, but will not,</div>
<div class="line">I believe, satisfy the student. From considerations like these</div>
<div class="line">I thought I should be doing some service to the Sanskrit read-</div>
<div class="line">ing public, if I compiled an English-Sanskrit Dictionary</div>
<div class="line">adapted to the wants of the student. The foregoing remarks</div>
<div class="line">are made not with the view of detracting from the high and</div>
<div class="line">acknowledged merits of the two works but solely to indicate</div>
<div class="line">the line I have followed, and the object I have had in compil-</div>
<div class="line">ing this work.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Some words are now necessary as to the plan and scope of</div>
<div class="line">the Dictionary. When I resolved to make this Dictionary as</div>
<div class="line">complete as possible, consistently with its aim of being useful</div>
<div class="line">for the student, I took the latest edition of Webster’s Complete</div>
<div class="line">Dictionary, and taking that as my basis, proceeded with the</div>
<div class="line">work of compilation. As I advanced, I found that several</div>
<div class="line">words, phrases and expressions and several senses of single</div>
<div class="line">words, could not be adeqately represented in Sanskrit, so as to</div>
<div class="line">appear like Sanskrit, either because the words &amp;c. were purely</div>
<div class="line">technical and referred to specific ideas in subjects, such as</div>
<div class="line">Chemistry, Botany, Medicine, Psychology, Law, Engineering</div>
<div class="line">&amp;c., or were such as had no corresponding ideas in Sanskrit and</div>
<div class="line">were peculiar to the English language. Words of this nature</div>
<div class="line">are numerous in Webster’s Dictionary, and I have omitted</div>
<div class="line">them, including also obsolete and rare words or senses of words.</div>
<div class="line">Several words of obvious signification, such as those formed</div>
<div class="line">by the prefixes’ <em>‘in,’ ‘mis,’ ‘pre,’ ‘un,’</em> are also omitted, as</div>
<div class="line">they may be easily formed from their second member. But the</div>
<div class="line">general terms of all sciences have been included, and of</div>
<div class="line">technical terms such as could be duly represented by Sanskrit</div>
<div class="line">equivalents actually existing in the language or by short,</div>
<div class="line">wieldy new combinations of words have been inserted. Of</div>
<div class="line">this description are words like Telegram, Democrat, Society,</div>
<div class="line">Literature, Address (of a letter) and several other words which</div>
<div class="line">have a peculiar sense in English and have to be translated by</div>
<div class="line">inventing equivalents. English. like many other languages, has</div>
<div class="line">so many expressions and idioms peculiar to itself, so many shades</div>
<div class="line">and nice distinctions of meaning, and so many new formations</div>
<div class="line">of words, progressing with the progress of the language, that it</div>
<div class="line">would be impossible to embrace them all in an English-Sanskrit</div>
<div class="line">Dictionary, even if it were the most comprehensive work, much</div>
<div class="line">more so, in a work designed principally for students. Take the</div>
<div class="line">words Line, Pass, Strong. Webster gives 21 senses under</div>
<div class="line">‘Line,’ 13 under ‘Pass (<em>v. i.</em>)’ and 20 under ‘Strong.’ Some</div>
<div class="line">of these are technica’ and some are not <em>different</em> senses as</div>
<div class="line">such, but shades of meaning or particularities of use; most of</div>
<div class="line">which may be translated by the words given for the general</div>
<div class="line">sense, (<em>see</em> the words)’. I have not thought it desirable, like</div>
<div class="line">Professor Monier Williams, to insert words the English</div>
<div class="line">explanation of which has to be systematically translated, in</div>
<div class="line">order to give some idea of their meaning. ‘Indian-rubber’ is</div>
<div class="line">translated by अतिस्थितिस्थापकविशिष्टो भारतदेशीयवृक्षनिर्यासः; ‘Shuttle cock’</div>
<div class="line">by लघुगुलिकाविशेषः यो विनोदार्थं दंडाहतो भूत्वा इतस्ततः प्रक्षिप्यतेः and many</div>
<div class="line">others of this nature, which can be translated by विशेषः ‘a kind</div>
<div class="line">of tree, flower, fruit’ &amp;c. Such words may be retained by the</div>
<div class="line">student in their English form, or their meaning may be</div>
<div class="line">translated if he desire to have them in a Sanskrit garb. स्पंजः</div>
<div class="line">‘Sponge,’ द्युकः ‘Duke,’ सावनं ‘Soap,’ लाटिनं ‘Latinity’ (as given</div>
<div class="line">by Mr. Borooah) may, I think, be very safely omitted even in</div>
<div class="line">a comprehensive Dictionary.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">To turn now to the plan and arrangement of the work.</div>
<div class="line">The most striking feature of the arrangement is that a</div>
<div class="line">word in its different parts of speech, compound words</div>
<div class="line">derived from it, derivatives formed from it either regularly,</div>
<div class="line">by means of terminations (<em>e. g.</em> ed, ing, ly, ness &amp;c.)</div>
<div class="line">or irregularly, have been given together, the derivatives be-</div>
<div class="line">ing arranged in order under the root or primitive word,</div>
<div class="line">by means of small black dashes. The dashes are</div>
<div class="line">intended to at once strike the eye and to direct it to the</div>
<div class="line">word after it; and when the “directions to the student” are</div>
<div class="line">remembered, there will, I believe, be no difficulty in referring</div>
<div class="line">words to the Dictionary. The principle of the arrangement is</div>
<div class="line">to give words according to the root-system; words regularly</div>
<div class="line">derived will, of course, be referred in their proper places; but</div>
<div class="line">words formed from the radical irregularly should also be refer-</div>
<div class="line">red under that radical. ‘Abstemious’ should be referred under</div>
<div class="line">‘Abstain,’ ‘Perception’ under ‘Perceive, ‘Death,’ ‘Dead,’</div>
<div class="line">under ‘Die,’ ‘Strength’ &amp;c., under ‘Strong,’ ‘Would,’ under</div>
<div class="line">‘Will,’ and so on; where it is not likely for the student to</div>
<div class="line">know where such words are given, reference is made to those</div>
<div class="line">places; <em>e. g.</em> see Material, Sight. One of the greatest advant-</div>
<div class="line">ages of the system has been practically, (whatever it may be</div>
<div class="line">theoretically) to effect a very large saving of space. To give</div>
<div class="line">the reader an idea of the vast saving effected by this system,</div>
<div class="line">it may be stated that, if the words in their different parts of</div>
<div class="line">speech and their compounds and derivatives were separately</div>
<div class="line">given, as in Monier Williams’ Dictionary, they would cover</div>
<div class="line">nearly 800 pages of this size, or 1, 000 of the size, style of print-</div>
<div class="line">ing, &amp;c. of Monier Williams’ Dictionary. Besides, by giving</div>
<div class="line">the words ‘Dead’ ‘Death’ under ‘Die,’ a considerable</div>
<div class="line">repetition of words is avoided. About 20 equivalents are given</div>
<div class="line">for ‘Die,’ and only a few are given for ‘Dead’; the rest can be</div>
<div class="line">formed in the same way from the roots immediately above; if it</div>
<div class="line">were given in its usual place, all words would have to be given</div>
<div class="line">or a reference made to ‘Die.’ My chief aim has been to give a</div>
<div class="line">good deal of matter in a small space, and this object is, I</div>
<div class="line">believe, considerably secured, as shown by the figures given</div>
<div class="line">above; and I have thus been enabled to give this book to the</div>
<div class="line">public at a cheap price.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The next point to be noticed is the number of equivalents</div>
<div class="line">that are given for a word. I believe that in an English-</div>
<div class="line">Sanskrit Dictionary, it is sufficient to give such words only as</div>
<div class="line">are of very frequent occurrence in Sanskrit authors. It cannot</div>
<div class="line">include all words in the language, and even if it could, it</div>
<div class="line">would be of no great use, since many of the words would be</div>
<div class="line">found to be very rarely used. The word ‘Gold’ has over 50</div>
<div class="line">synonyms given for it in the different lexicons; ‘Sun’ has</div>
<div class="line">nearly a hundred. But it will easily be seen that, excepting</div>
<div class="line">some, the synonyms are either combinations of simple words,</div>
<div class="line">or are descriptive epithets. Of this class are the words</div>
<div class="line">वक्रपुच्छः, ललजिव्हः, रात्रिजागरः, for ‘Dog.’ Mr. Borooah in his</div>
<div class="line">Dictionary has given only a few equivalents, in some instances,</div>
<div class="line">only one, where there were 5 most commonly used; Prof.</div>
<div class="line">Williams has very often given too many equivalents, grouping</div>
<div class="line">together common and rare, synonyms proper and epithets. In</div>
<div class="line">the former case the student will hardly have any room left for</div>
<div class="line">choosing his word, while in the latter, he will be at a loss to</div>
<div class="line">see which to choose. In giving equivalents in this Dictionary,</div>
<div class="line">whether for Substantives, Adjectives, Adverbs or Verbs, I have</div>
<div class="line">endeavoured to strike a middle course between these two</div>
<div class="line">courses, and, have kept one principle steadily in view: to give</div>
<div class="line">such words as are found frequently used in the works of</div>
<div class="line">standard authors. The equivalents are arranged in the order</div>
<div class="line">of their frequency of use; and the student, in his ordinary</div>
<div class="line">prose composition, would do well to make his selection from</div>
<div class="line">the first few equivalents enumerated. In the case of Verbs it</div>
<div class="line">has not been possible to maintain this principle with perfect</div>
<div class="line">accuracy in every case, but it is generally maintained. It is</div>
<div class="line">only in a few cases of substantives that I have gone the length</div>
<div class="line">of giving all words enumerated in the Amarakosha; and in the</div>
<div class="line">case of names of material substances, names of plants and</div>
<div class="line">trees that have been identified, and in a few others, all the</div>
<div class="line">words given in the Amarakosha have been here incorporated,</div>
<div class="line">care being taken to arrange them in the order of their useful-</div>
<div class="line">ness. Similarly such Genders, Padas or Conjugations are</div>
<div class="line">given as will be found generally used; I have very rarely given</div>
<div class="line">all possible ones. It has not been thought necessary to give the</div>
<div class="line">3rd person singular, Present tense, nor all possible derivatives</div>
<div class="line">from simple words; they will have, if necessary, to be made up</div>
<div class="line">according to the “Directions” afterwards given. In giving</div>
<div class="line">equivalents for a word in its different senses, it has also not</div>
<div class="line">been thought necessary to give the meanings in English, except</div>
<div class="line">where it was necessary to note a particular sense. One word</div>
<div class="line">in Sanskrit often represents several meanings in English, and</div>
<div class="line">to render them into Sanskrit, the Sanskrit word has to be</div>
<div class="line">repeated. This accounts for the repetition of some Sanskrit</div>
<div class="line">words under different meanings.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In will be noticed that there are several sentences given to</div>
<div class="line">illustrate the meanings of words, some of which are quotations</div>
<div class="line">from standard authors, as will be readily seen from the</div>
<div class="line">references given after them; but many of the phrases and</div>
<div class="line">sentences that are translated, and are not supported by any</div>
<div class="line">authority, are taken from the “Student’s Hand-Book of</div>
<div class="line">Progressive Exercises,” Part II. I deemed it essential to illust-</div>
<div class="line">rate, in some cases at least, the <em>construction</em> of the equivalents</div>
<div class="line">given, wherever it was peculiar in Sanskrit; and I thought I</div>
<div class="line">could do this better if I gave sentences from classical authors</div>
<div class="line">instead of framing them myself. The quotations have become</div>
<div class="line">quite necessary in those cases where equivalents have been</div>
<div class="line">here suggested for the first time; I thought I should produce my</div>
<div class="line">vouchers for a particular word that I suggested rather than</div>
<div class="line">leave the reader in doubt as to its genuineness. In a few cases the</div>
<div class="line">English or Sanskrit sentences are closely translated; in a few</div>
<div class="line">others only such parts of the Sanskrit sentences are translated</div>
<div class="line">as are sufficient to illustrate the word intended to be illustrat-</div>
<div class="line">ed, while in several cases, Sanskrit sentences alone are given</div>
<div class="line">which might be readily understood by the student. On a reference</div>
<div class="line">to the names of works or authors drawn upon for quotations,</div>
<div class="line">it will be found that the list is not very comprehensive; several</div>
<div class="line">large and useful works have been left out, and works falling</div>
<div class="line">in the range of classical literature excluded. But my principal</div>
<div class="line">aim in giving quotations has been to supply the student with</div>
<div class="line">good expressions from works <em>within his easy reach</em> so that he might</div>
<div class="line">study, if necessary. the particular places referred to. Kalidasa’s</div>
<div class="line">works and Bana’s Kadambari are more frequently drawn upon</div>
<div class="line">than the Ramayana, the Mahabhharata, the Naishadha or the</div>
<div class="line">Mahâvîracharita.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">An attempt has been made to avoid as much unneccessary</div>
<div class="line">repetition as was possible, without marring the usefulness of</div>
<div class="line">the work. A Dictionary is necessarily a work of repetition;</div>
<div class="line">several words have to be unavoidably repeated, howsoever un-</div>
<div class="line">willing one might be to do so. I have thought it necessary to</div>
<div class="line">make reference under some words to preceding or succeeding</div>
<div class="line">parts of the Dictionary, chiefly with the view of avoiding</div>
<div class="line">repetition; but in such cases a few equivalents are given, and</div>
<div class="line">the student is told to follow out the reference, if he want to</div>
<div class="line">know more about the word. Take, for instance, the words,</div>
<div class="line">Beguile, Cheat, Deceive, Delude, Defraud, Impose upon, Take</div>
<div class="line">in; or Blame, Censure, Reprove, Reproach, Scold, Reprimand,</div>
<div class="line">Reprehend; or Path, Road, Way: these words, whatever be their</div>
<div class="line">shades of meaning in English, are, when represented in</div>
<div class="line">Sanskrit, almost synonymous, and may be conveniently</div>
<div class="line">represented by the same words. If ten or fifteen equivalents</div>
<div class="line">under one of these words, say, Cheat, Censure, or Way, are</div>
<div class="line">given, it would be unnecessary to repeat all of them again</div>
<div class="line">under the synonymous words. In all such cases, therefore,</div>
<div class="line">references have been made to some general word under which</div>
<div class="line">are given all the equivalents. In a few cases the reference has</div>
<div class="line">been made, not for any equivalents, but for any expressions,</div>
<div class="line">phrases, idioms &amp;c. that may have been given under the</div>
<div class="line">principal word. In no case will the student have to refer to</div>
<div class="line">the Dictionary <em>more than twice.</em></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In a work which professes to deal with the phrases and</div>
<div class="line">expressions of the English Language, the writer cannot afford</div>
<div class="line">to disregard the several small useful proverbs, mottoes, or other</div>
<div class="line">expressions which have become proverbial. I have, with this</div>
<div class="line">view, inserted, under some principal word therein, such</div>
<div class="line">proverbs &amp;c., and have given exact or approximate equivalents,</div>
<div class="line">wherever they existed in Sanskrit, and have in a few cases</div>
<div class="line">given my own translation of them. Of this nature are proverbs</div>
<div class="line">given under Bush, Handsome, Make, Oil, Race, Something,</div>
<div class="line">Suffer, Touch &amp;c.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">With regard to the method of writing the Sanskrit equival-</div>
<div class="line">ents, an objection might possibly be raised. Throughout the</div>
<div class="line">work the usual practice of representing every anusvara in the</div>
<div class="line">body of a word by its corresponding nasals has been rejected</div>
<div class="line">and the anusvara sign is invariably used, where usually a</div>
<div class="line">nasal would stand. I have not been able to understand the</div>
<div class="line">principle on which scholars reject this system and betake</div>
<div class="line">themselves solely to the other; though the anusvara system is</div>
<div class="line">most convenient in printing, and occasionally saves much</div>
<div class="line">misunderstanding. Besides, it is a practice generally followed</div>
<div class="line">in our old Manuscripts, and is sanctioned by Panini as being</div>
<div class="line">optional. For these reasons I have scrupulously followed it in</div>
<div class="line">this Dictionary, but more especially because it is very conveni-</div>
<div class="line">ent in printing. The rules of Sandhi, to make the words</div>
<div class="line">clearly intelligible, are not in all cases strictly observed.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">It now remains for me to do the grateful duty of acknow-</div>
<div class="line">ledging my obligations to those that have assisted me in the</div>
<div class="line">preparation of the Dictionary in one form or another.</div>
<div class="line">Foremost among them stand the works of Mr. Borooah and</div>
<div class="line">Prof. Williams, both of which I have most frequently consult-</div>
<div class="line">ed. Monier Williams’ Dictionary, though inferior in several</div>
<div class="line">respects to Mr. Borooah’s, has several happy renderings of</div>
<div class="line">short words and expressions, especially where ideas, purely</div>
<div class="line">English, have to be clothed in a Sanskrit garb, and I have freely</div>
<div class="line">consulted his Dictionary for such renderings. I have also</div>
<div class="line">frequently referred to the learned Professor’s valuable Sanskrit-</div>
<div class="line">English Dictionary; for both of which my sincere thanks are</div>
<div class="line">due to him. But my acknowledgments are chiefly due to Mr.</div>
<div class="line">Borooah, from whose work I have derived much substantial</div>
<div class="line">assistance, in the suggestion of equivalents for words or</div>
<div class="line">phrases, more particularly from his numerous quotations, and</div>
<div class="line">therein again, quotations from such works as were not</div>
<div class="line">accessible to me, or being accessible, I had no time at my</div>
<div class="line">disposal sufficient to go through them. I have also had to</div>
<div class="line">keep constantly by my side, the useful Sanskrit Lexicon – the</div>
<div class="line">Kosha of Amarasimha – made more useful by the edition</div>
<div class="line">published by the Department of Public Instruction, Bombay.</div>
<div class="line">In giving illustrative sentences from classical Authors, I have</div>
<div class="line">used annotations or translations wherever they existed, and</div>
<div class="line">have derived hints from them and have occasionally adopted</div>
<div class="line">their translation. My thanks are due to all annotators, editors</div>
<div class="line">or translators of such works. I have to thank sincerely Prof.</div>
<div class="line">R. G. Bhandarkar, M. A. Deccan College, Poona, who kindly</div>
<div class="line">proposed suitable equivalents for some difficult words and</div>
<div class="line">phrases which were referred to him. I have also to thank my</div>
<div class="line">friend, Mr. Ganesh Krishna Garde. L. M. &amp; S., for having</div>
<div class="line">supplied me with accurate equivalents for some knotty and</div>
<div class="line">technical terms in Medicine, from books and sources which</div>
<div class="line">I had no time to reach, and which even if I had time to reach</div>
<div class="line">and use, I could not, unaided by him, turn to much practical</div>
<div class="line">account. Lastly, my thanks are due to several kind and</div>
<div class="line">obliging friends who assisted me either in collecting materials</div>
<div class="line">for the Dictionary, or in carrying it through the Press.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In conclusion, I trust that the Dictionary will be useful</div>
<div class="line">not only to those for whose use it is principally prepared, but</div>
<div class="line">to the general public also who may wish to avail themselves</div>
<div class="line">of appliances calculated to help the study of Sanskrit. It is</div>
<div class="line">my belief that, except for the translation of passages from</div>
<div class="line">purely technical subjects, such as Chemistry, Botany, Medicine,</div>
<div class="line">Philosophy etc., this Dictionary will be useful to all readers of</div>
<div class="line">Sanskrit for translating any passage dealing with ordinary</div>
<div class="line">subjects. None is more conscious than myself of the defects</div>
<div class="line">of the book, and of the mistakes or inaccuracies that might</div>
<div class="line">have crept into it, in spite of my vigilance; and when a second</div>
<div class="line">edition is prepared, I shall endeavour, to the best of my ability,</div>
<div class="line">to make the Dictionary complete in itself. I shall be very</div>
<div class="line">happy to receive any suggestions that readers may have to</div>
<div class="line">make and shall be but too willing to adopt them, if I find them</div>
<div class="line">useful. With these prefatory remarks I leave the work to the</div>
<div class="line">indulgent judgment of the public.</div>

<div class="line">(TO BE STUDIED BEFORE USING THE DICTIONARY.)</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">1. Words and their derivatives are arranged in the follow-</div>
<div class="line">ing order: first the radical or primitive word, in all its different</div>
<div class="line">parts of speech; then compound words, arranged in alphabetical</div>
<div class="line">order; (in the case of verbs, such words as Break off, Turn out,</div>
<div class="line">are given as -off, -out); and then the derivatives which are</div>
<div class="line">always distinguished by a black dash; those formed regularly</div>
<div class="line">being given first, and the irregular ones, written fully, after</div>
<div class="line">them (<em>see</em> Ambition, Humble, Young.)</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><em>Note.</em> – This order is not regularly observed in the first</div>
<div class="line">three letters, compound words and derivatives being, in a few</div>
<div class="line">cases, both distinguished by black dashes.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">2. In giving the terminations by which derivatives are</div>
<div class="line">formed, the changes which the final and initial letters undergo,</div>
<div class="line"><em>e. g.</em> the dropping, doubling or assimilation of letters are as-</div>
<div class="line">sumed; the terminations being always given in their original</div>
<div class="line">form; <em>see</em> Cut, Hurry, Mature.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">3. (<em>a</em>) A small black dash (-) marks the commencement</div>
<div class="line">of a new derivative. (<em>b</em>) A word preceded by a large black</div>
<div class="line">dash (-) indicates that the derivatives given after it, are from</div>
<div class="line">that word and <em>not</em> from the radical or primitive word; <em>see</em> Die,</div>
<div class="line">Dead. (<em>c</em>) A hyphen used in the middle of Sanskrit words</div>
<div class="line">indicates that each of the members separated by the hyphen is</div>
<div class="line">to be repeated with the word after it; or that the word after</div>
<div class="line">the hyphen is to be taken as an alternative for the word im-</div>
<div class="line">mediately before it (to be, in some cases, decided by the context),</div>
<div class="line"><em>e. g.</em> in HAVE, <em>l.</em> 9, यथाकामं-स्वरुच्या-वृत् means यथाकामं वृत्, स्वरुच्या वृत्; in</div>
<div class="line">PRACTICE, <em>l.</em> 3, नित्यवृत्तिः-चर्या अनुष्ठानं means नित्यवृत्तिः, नित्यचर्या, नित्यानुष्ठानं।</div>
<div class="line">(<em>d</em>) A hyphen followed by a comma (-,) indicates that the</div>
<div class="line">word after it may stand by itself or may be joined with the</div>
<div class="line">word before it; <em>e. g.</em> in PLACE <em>l.</em> 1, प्र-, देशः means the word is either</div>
<div class="line">देशः or प्रदेशः; (<em>e</em>) A comma followed by a hyphen (,-) indicates</div>
<div class="line">that the word after it may be compounded with the word</div>
<div class="line">preceding it; <em>e. g.</em> in STAGE <em>l.</em> 1, रंगः-, शाला means the word is either</div>
<div class="line">रंगः, or रंगशाला। (<em>f</em>) º denotes that the word immediately before it</div>
<div class="line">which is separated by a comma, may be compounded with the</div>
<div class="line">words which it connects; <em>e. g.</em> PREVENT, <em>l.</em> 1 वृ c.. नि-विनि°, means</div>
<div class="line">the root is also निवृ c. and विनिवृ c.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">4. In the case of substantives, the nominative case, wherever</div>
<div class="line">it could at once indicate the gender, has been given; the visarga</div>
<div class="line">thus indicates masculine gender, and anusvára neuter gender.</div>
<div class="line">Where the nominative is not indicative of the gender, it is</div>
<div class="line">given as <em>m., f., n.,</em> as the case may be. All substantives ending</div>
<div class="line">in consonants have their genders specified as <em>m., f.,</em> or <em>n.</em></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">5. In the case of adjectives, the simple base only is given.</div>
<div class="line">The feminine of the majority of adjectives in अ ends in आ, and</div>
<div class="line">adjectives ending in इ, उ have generally the same base for all</div>
<div class="line">genders. In all such cases the simple base is given, the genders</div>
<div class="line">being formed regularly according to similar substantive bases.</div>
<div class="line">Irregular feminines are denoted in brackets. (<em>f.</em>) Bases ending</div>
<div class="line">in त्, न्, स्, form their feminine regularly in ती, नी, सी,</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">6. (<em>a</em>) In the case of verbs, the Arabic figure denotes the</div>
<div class="line">conjugation to which the root belongs; <strong>P</strong> denoting Parasmaipada,</div>
<div class="line"><strong>A</strong> Atmanepada, and <strong>U</strong> Ubhayapada (P &amp; A.) Roots of the tenth</div>
<div class="line">conjugation belong to both Padas, theoretically at least; and</div>
<div class="line">hence 10 is used for all roots of this conjugation, though the</div>
<div class="line">Parasmaipada, unless where otherwise specified, should be</div>
<div class="line">generally preferred for use. (<em>b</em>) c. denotes causal, and is form-</div>
<div class="line">ed from roots by making the same changes as in the</div>
<div class="line">10th conjugation. Wherever it cannot be formed by this</div>
<div class="line">general rule, it is shown in brackets. (<em>e</em>) <em>D.</em> means Denomina-</div>
<div class="line">tives; here the 3rd pers. singular Present tense is given</div>
<div class="line">throughout.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">7. All the derivatives from a word are not always given</div>
<div class="line">when they may be easily supplied; more especially, in the case</div>
<div class="line">of potential passive participles, formed by तव्य, य, अनीय, past</div>
<div class="line">participles, present participles, verbal nouns, abstract nouns</div>
<div class="line">from adjectives, and adverbs from adjectives. Where there</div>
<div class="line">was any peculiarity in the formation of these derivatives,</div>
<div class="line">they are given; but in many cases the student will have to</div>
<div class="line">supply the forms, according to rules given in grammars.</div>
