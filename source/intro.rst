Cologne Sanskrit Lexicon Overview
=================================

The introductory paragraph from the 1997 paper 
`Report on the Cologne Sanskrit Dictionary Project <http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/CDSL.pdf>`__
still provides a good summary of the goals of  the project and its accompanying
`web site <http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/>`__ :

  The Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon (CDSL) project undertakes to digitize and merge
  the major bilingual Sanskrit dictionaries compiled in the 19th century. Its aim is to
  provide a basic lexical corpus to provide an easy access to all available meanings of
  Sanskrit words and to allow the creation of a number of computer programs that will
  help to analyze Sanskrit texts.


According to  the web-site's home page, there are digitizations of: 
 * 11 bilingual Sanskrit-English dictionaries
 *  3 English-Sanskrit dictionaries
 *  2 Sanskrit-French dictionaries
 *  5 Sanskrit-German dictionaries
 *  1 Sanskrit-Latin dictionary
 *  2 Sanskrit-Sanskrit dictionaries
 * 10 specialized dictionaries.

Each of these dictionaries has a suite of 4 :doc:`displays <displays/index>`.  
A collection of :doc:`download materials <downloads/index>` is available for experienced users.
