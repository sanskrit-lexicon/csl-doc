APPENDIX II. Writers
--------------------

| Giving the dates &c. of important Sanskrit writers.

| आर्यभदृ¦ A well-known astronomer. Born A. D. 476.

| उद्भट¦ One of the earliest writers on Alankâra. He
| was the chief Pandit or Sabhâpati of king Ja-
| yâpîda of Kâshmir (779-813 A. D.).

| कय्यट¦ Author of the भाष्यप्रदीप, being a commen-
| tary on Patanjali's महाभाष्य। He is considered by
| Dr. Buhler to be not older than the 13th century.

| कल्हण¦ The author of the well-known राजतरंगिणी ‘the
| chronicle of kings’. He was a contemporay of Jaya-
| simha of Kâshmir who reigned from 1129-1150
| A. D.

| कालिदास¦ The celebrated author of the अभिज्ञानशकुंतल,
| विक्रमोर्वशीय, मालविकाग्निमित्र, रघुवंश, कुमारसंभव, मेघदूत, ऋतु-
| संहार; also of the poems नलोदय and of some other
| minor works. The earliest known authentic refer-
| ence to Kâlidâsa is in an inscription dated 556
| \ *S*\ ake or 634 A. D., in which he and Bhâravi
| are spoken of as being renowned poets. The verse
| is as follows:--
| येनायोजि न वेश्म
| स्थिरमर्थविधौ विवेकिना जिनवेश्म ।
| स विजयतां रविकीर्तिः
| कविताश्रितकालिदासभारविकीर्तिः ॥

| Bâṇa's reference to him in the beginning of his
| Harsha-charita also shows that he must have flou-
| rished before the time of Bâṇa, \ *i. e.*\  before the
| first half of the seventh century. But how long
| before the seventh century the poet flourished
| is not yet known. According to Mallinâtha's ex-
| planation on Me. 14 निचुल and दिङ्नाग were con-
| temporaries of Kâlidâsa. If Mallinatha's sug-
| gestion be correct-and it is very doubtful if it be
| really so-then our poet must have lived in the
| middle of the sixth century which is the date
| usually assigned to दिङ्नाग।

| There is one point which, if definitely settled,
| would give the poet's precise date. It is the
| mention by Kâlidâsa of his patron Vikrama.
| Who this Vikrama is it has not yet been definite-
| ly settled. Popular tradition identifies him with
| the founder of the Samvat Era which is said to
| have commenced 56 B. C. If this view be cor-
| rect, Kâlidâsa must be considered as belonging
| to the first century before Christ. But some
| scholars have recently come to the conclusion
| that what is called the era of Vikramâditya
| 56. B C. was a date arrived at by taking the date 
| of the great battle of Korūr in which Vikrama
| finally defeated the Mlechch has, \ *i. e.*\  544 A. D,
| and then by throwing back the beginning of the
| new era 600 years before that date, \ *i. e.*\  56 B.
| C. If this conclusion be accepted as correct-and
| scholars do not seem to have yet agreed on the
| point-Kâlidâsa must have flourished in the sixth
| century A. D. The question is still an open one.

| क्षेमेंद्र¦ A well-known poet of Kâshmir, author of
| समयमातृका and several other works. He flourished
| during the second and the third quarter of the
| 11th century.

| जगद्धर¦ N. of a celebrated commentator, who has
| written commentaries on the Mâlatî-Mâdava and
| Veṇi4-Samhâra. He lived after the 14th century.

| जगन्नाथपंडित¦ N. of a celebrated modern author.
| His most celebrated work is the रसगंगाधर a trea-
| tise on Rhetoric or Poetics; his other works
| are भामिनीविलास, the five \ *laharis*\  (गंगा, पयूष, सुधा,
| अमृत, करुणा), and a few minor works. He is
| supposed to have flourished during the time of
| the Emperor Shah Jahan of Delhi. He must
| have also seen the latter end of Jehangir's reign,
| and the temporary accession of Dârâ to the
| throne in 1658. His date, --at least, his active
| career-lay, therefore, between 1620 and 1660 A. D.

| जयदेव¦ Author of that charming lyric poem the
| Gîtagovinda. He was an inhabitant of the village
| Kinduwilva in the Vîrabhūmi district of Bengal. He
| is said to have lived in the time of a king called
| Lakshmaṇasena who is identified by Dr. Buhler
| with the Vaidya king of Bengal whose inscription
| is dated Vikrama Samvat 1173 or 1116 A. D. The
| poet must have, therefore, flourished in the 12th
| century.

| दंडिन्¦ Author of the Da\ *s*\ akumâracharita and Kâvyâ-
| dar\ *s*\ a. He flourished in the latter half of the sixth
| century, and was a contemporary of Bâṇa, accord-
| ing to Mâdhavâchàrya.

| पतंजलि¦ The celebrated author of the Mahâbhâshyat.
| He is said to have lived about 150 B. C.

| नारायण (भट्टनारायण)¦ Author of the Veṇî-Samhâra.
| He must have flourished before the 9th century as
| his work is frequently quoted by the poet Ananda-
| vardhana in his work called ध्यन्यालोक। This poet
| flourished under the reign of Avantivarman 855-
| 884 A. D. (Râj. T. 5. 34)

| बाण¦ The well-known author of the Harshacharita, 
| Kâdambarî and Chaṇḍikâ\ *s*\ ataka. Pârvatîpariṇaya
| and Ratnâvalî are also ascribed to him. His date
| is indisputably fixed by that of his patron Harsha-
| vardhana of Kânyakubja who was reigning during
| the whole of Hiouen Thsang's travels in India
| which lasted from 629 to 645 A. D. Bâṇa must,
| therefore, have lived in the latter half of the sixth
| or the first half of the seventh century. The date
| of Bâṇa is useful in ascertaining the dates-at least
| the \ *termini ad quem*\  --of several writers mentioned
| by him in his introduction to the Harsha Charita.

| बिल्हण¦ Author of the Mahâkàvya Vikramânkadevacha-
| rita and of Chaurapanchá\ *s*\ ikâ. He flourished in
| the latter half of the 11th century.

| भट्टि¦ A son of \ *S*\ rî Svâmin, who lived in Vallabhi
| during the reign of king \ *S*\ ridharasena or of Nar-
| endra, the son of Srîdhara, who is supposed by
| Lassen to have reigned from 530 to 545 A. D.

| भर्तृहरि¦ Author of the three \ *S*\ atakas and of the Vâkya-
| padîya. Mr. Telang gives it as his opinion that
| he must have flourished about the close of the
| first and the beginning of the second century of
| the Christian era. Tradition makes him brother of
| king Vikrama, and if this Vikrama be accepted
| as the same who defeated the Mlechchhas in 544
| A. D., we must suppose Bhartṛihari to have flourish-
| ed in the latter half of the sixth century.

| भवभूति¦ The well-known author of the Mahâvīracharita,
| Mâlatî Mâdhava, and Uttararâmacharita. He was
| a native of Vidarba and lived at the court of king
| Ya\ *s*\ ovarman of Kânyakubja, who was subdued by
| Lalitâditya of Kâshmir (693-729 A. D.) Bhava-
| bhūti flcurished therefore at the end of the 7th
| century, and this date is consistent with Bâṇa's
| omission of his name. All anecdotes about the
| contemporaneity of Kâlidâsa and Bhavabhūti must
| be rejected as absolute myths.

| भारवि¦ Author of the Kirátàrjunîya; mentioned along
| with Kâlidâsa in an inscription dated 634. See
| कालिदास।

| भास¦ Mentioned by Bâṇa and Kâlidâsa as their pre-
| decessor. Flourished before the 7th century.

| मयूर¦ Father-in-law of Bâṇa and author of the Sūrya-
| \ *S*\ ataka composed by him to be freed from leprosy.
| A contemporary of Bâṇa q. v.

| मम्मट¦ N. of the author of the Kàvyapraká\ *s*\ a. He 
| must have flourished before 1294 A. D. in
| which year a commentary on that work by name
| Jayantî was written by one Jayanta.

| मुरारि¦ Author of the Anargha-râghava mentioned by
| the poet Ratnâkara (who flourished in the 9th
| century) in Haravijaya 38. 67. He must, therefore
| be placed before the 9th century.

| रत्नाकर¦ Author of the Mahâkâvya called Haravijaya
| and patronized by Avantivarman (855-884 A. D.).

| राजशेखर¦ Author of the Bâla-Râmáyaṇa, Bâla-Bhârata,
| and Viddha\ *s*\ âlabhanjikâ. He lived after Bhavabhūti
| and before the end of the tenth century, that is,
| he flourished between the end of the 7th and
| the middle of the 10th century.

| वराहमिहिर¦ A celebrated astronomer, author of the
| Bṛihat-Samhitâ. He died in 587 A. D.

| विक्रम¦ See कालिदास।

| विशाखदत्त¦ Author of the Mudráràkshasa. The 7th
| or 8th century is regarded by Mr. Telang as
| the probable date of the production of the drama.

| शंकर¦ The celebrated teacher of the Vedánta philoso-
| phy and author of the शारीरकभाष्य and of a large
| number of original works, especially on Vedânta.
| He is said to have been born in 788 A. D. and
| to have died in 820 at the early age of 32. But
| some scholars (Mr. Telang, Dr. Bhandarkar &c.)
| have tried to show that \ *S*\ ankara's date must
| be the 6th or 7th century at the latest. See In-
| troduction to Mudrâràkshasa.

| सुबंधु¦ The author of Vâsavadattâ mentioned by Bâṇa,
| and so not later than the 7th century. He men-
| tions a work of Dharma-kîrti by name बौद्धसंगति
| which is supposed to belong to the sixth century.

| श्रीहर्ष¦ The reputed author of the Naishadhacharita
| and of 7 or 8 other works. He is generally
| placed in the latter half of the 12th century.
| (Wilson says that \ *S*\ rîharsha succeeded his father
| Kala\ *s*\ a in 1113, and that the Ratnâvalî, a play
| ascribed to the king, must have been written by
| him between 1113 and 1125 the close of his reign.
| But the Ratnâvalî must be regarded as a work of
| an earlier date as it is largely quoted in the
| Da\ *s*\ arūpa, a work of the last part of the 10th cen-
| tury).

| हर्ष¦ The patron of Bâṇa, see बाण। The Ratnâvalî is
| supposed to have been written by Bâṇa and pub-
| lished under his patron's name.
