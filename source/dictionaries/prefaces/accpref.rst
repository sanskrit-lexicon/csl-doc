PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1962
------------------------------

| 
| The » Alphabetical Register of Sanskrit Works and Authors «, based mainly on the Catalogues
| and Lists of Indian manuscripts published up to 1902, serves as an indispensable standard
| reference work for all those who are interested in Sanskrit literature.
| 
| It was due to the brilliant intellect and the indefatigable endeavours of Theodor Aufrecht
| that Indology was provided with this reliable guide through an intricate mass of material.
| 
| The first two parts of the original edition of 1891 and 1896 were printed with the financial
| assistance of the Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft (the “German Oriental Society”), where-
| as the third part was published in 1903 with the help of the Academies of Göttingen, Leipzig,
| Munich and Vienna.
| 
| For a long time the CATALOGUS CATALOGORUM was out of print, a circumstance deeply regretted
| by many scholars, institutions and libraries. Now that the new edition becomes available, our
| thanks are due to the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (the “German Research Association”)
| for its liberal support which permitted the reprinting of the masterly work of Th. Aufrecht.
| Tübingen, July 31 st 1962.

PREFACE, PART I
---------------

| We shall hardly ever succeed in accomplishing for Sanskrit Literature what has already been done to
| good purpose in several important branches of Arabic, namely to give an accurate description of its works, their
| authors, and the time these have lived in. The compass of the former is so vast, extending as it does over a
| period of 2500 years, and the lack of interest in historical truth in India is so great, that difficulties meet the
| inquirer at every step. The attempt, however, to give an account of the whole of Sanskrit Literature as contained
| in Manuscripts deposited in India as well as in Europe, was to be made, and it fell to my lot to undertake this
| task. The present work is the result of a labour of nearly thirty years, and its imperfections must be excused
| owing to the nature of the materials at my disposal, and my absence from the great centres of Manuscripts and
| Books, the Libraries of Berlin and of the India Office in London. A work of this kind is doomed to remain
| incomplete. Not to speak of India, where new discoveries are made daily, it seems almost incredible that the
| Libraries of the Asiatic Society of Calcutta, of Paris, of the British Museum, of the Asiatic Society in London,
| still remain without a Catalogue of their Sanskrit MSS., and that information about these can only be obtained
| by personal inquiry, or by consulting their written lists which are full of errors. From my own experience I
| know that bundles of Sanskrit MSS. are scattered in Public and Private Libraries of England without attracting
| any notice. On this account it is possible that in Europe discoveries of important Sanskrit works can still be made.
| 
| The title Catalogus Catalogorum merely serves to express the sources from which the present work is
| derived. By the favour of the Government in India, no less than by that of private friends, I was supplied with
| what, I believe, is nearly a complete collection of printed lists of Sanskrit MSS. To arrange and sift the matter
| therein contained required a great amount of perseverance and discretion. Fortunately, some of the Catalogues
| which have appeared in Europe, and a few published by some truly learned Scholars in India, have often
| afforded clues to escape from mazes of otherwise inextricable confusion. The Catalogues and Lists I have made
| use of are the following.
| 
| 1. *Jones.* A Catalogue of Sanscrit and other Oriental Manuscripts presented to the Royal Society by
| Sir William and Lady Jones. Printed in Sir William Jones' Works. London 1807. 8. Vol. XIII, p. 401-15.
| This is a small collection of MSS., which were all copied for Sir William Jones. It is now being kept in the
| Library of the India Office. Quoted by pages. This mode of quotation is adopted in all cases where no remark
| is made to the contrary.
| 
| 2. *Mack.* Mackenzie Collection. A descriptive Catalogue of the Oriental Manuscripts collected by the
| late Lieut. Col. Colin Mackenzie. By H. H. Wilson. Calcutta 1828. 8. This collection was made in the South,
| and the greater part of it is now in the Library of the India Office.
| 
| 3. *Copenh.* Codices Indici Bibliothecae Regiae Havniensis enumerati et descripti a N. L. Westergaard.
| Havniae 1846. 4. Principally from the collection made by Erasmus Rask. 
| 
| 4. *Pet.* Verzeichniss der auf Indien bezüglichen Handschriften und Holzdrucke im Asiatischen Museum,
| von Otto Böhtlingk. Printed in Das Asiatische Museum zu St. Petersburg von Dr. Bernh. Dorn. St. Petersburg
| 1846. 8. I was unable to obtain some other lists of Sanskrit Mss., which are extant at St. Petersburg.
| 
| 5. *IO.* The Library of the India Office in London contains the collections of Colebrooke, Wilkins,
| Taylor, the Gaikawar, Johnson, Fleet, Ballantyne, Burnell, and others. When my work went to press, only the
| first part of the valuable Catalogue by Professor Eggeling, containing the Vedic Manuscripts, was then published.
| By the courtesy of the Author I was allowed the use of the proof-sheets of the second part, and those of the
| third part as far as page 552. My work would have been materially benefited, could I have waited for the
| completion of the whole. But there is no prospect of this Catalogue being finished for perhaps another ten years.
| The loss thereby caused has to a small extent been remedied by my having examined about 1150 volumes while
| residing in England, and afterwards during my occasional visits to London.
| 
| 6. *W.* Verzeichniss der Sanskrit-Handschriften (der Königlichen Bibliothek in Berlin) von A. Weber.
| Berlin 1853. 4. This is a pattern of what a Catalogue ought to be, and it deals with MSS. which in their
| bulk are not surpassed in value by any other collection in Europe.
| 
| 7. *Oxf.* Catalogus Codicum Sanscriticorum Bibliothecae Bodleianae. Confecit Th. Aufrecht. Oxonii
| 1864. 4. Since this Catalogue was printed, the Bodleian Library, with the exception of Hultzsch's collection,
| has not much increased its store of Sanskrit MSS. These additional MSS. I have examined and have, with only
| a few exceptions, entered in the present book.
| 
| 8. *Cambr.* A Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge. By
| Th. Aufrecht. Cambridge 1869. 8. The University Library in Cambridge has collected a considerable number
| of Sanskrit works, which ought to be made known to the Learned.
| 
| 9. *Paris.* No printed Catalogue is in existence. Fortunately, I was able to avail myself of a written
| alphabetical Catalogue compiled by S. Munk, of which an abridged copy was made for Lassen by Goldstücker.
| Mr. Feer was obliging enough to send me in 1886 a list of later additions under the title of ‘Liste des titres
| de Manuscrits Sanskrits ajoutes au Catalogue de Munk, augmentée des titres des Manuscrits en caracteres autres
| que le Devanāgari et le Bengali qui ne sont pas donnés dans le Catalogue’. I have great pleasure in recording
| my thanks to Mr. Féer publicly.--Both lists are unfortunately replete with errors. Burnouf's MSS. are
| enumerated in the catalogue of sale of his books. They are few and not valuable. The small Catalogue by
| Hamilton and Lagles, Paris 1807. 8. I could not procure on the Continent.--Quoted by the numbers of
| entry in the written Catalogue.
| 
| 10. *Hall.* A contribntion towards an Index to the Bibliography of the Indian Philosophical systems.
| By Fitzedward Hall. Calcutta 1859. 8. It would be presumption on my part to speak in praise of a work
| which by universal consent is considered to be unique and perfect in its particular department.
| 
| 11. *L.* Notices of Sanskrit MSS. by Rājendralāla Mitra. Calcutta 1871--90. Nine volumes in 8, and
| the first part of the tenth. This is decidedly the best analysis of Sanskrit Mss., which up to the present time
| has been made by a Native of India. The copious extracts are very useful, and enable the attentive reader to
| judge of the contents of a work, even where he is deserted by the English text. The indefatigable industry of
| the Editor deserves every kind of commendation.--Quoted by numbers.
| 
| 12. *Khn.* A classified alphabetical Catalogue of Sanskrit MSS. in the Southern division of the Bombay
| Presidency. Compiled by F. Kielhorn. Fascicle I. Bombay 1869. 8.
| 
| 13. *K.* A Catalogue of Sanskrit MSS. existing in the Central Provinces. Edited by F. Kielhorn.
| Nagpur 1874. 8. 
| 
| 14. *Kh.* Report on the search for Sanskrit MSS. in the Bombay Presidency during the year 1880--81.
| By F. Kielhorn. Bombay 1881. 8.
| 
| 15. *B.* A Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts contained in the Private Libraries of Gujarāt, Kāṭhiāvād,
| Kachchh, Sindh, and Khāndeç. Compiled under the Superintendence of G. Bühler. Four fascicles. Bombay
| 1871--73. 8.
| 
| 16. *Report.* Detailed Report of a tour in search of Sanskrit MSS. made in Kāçmīr, Rajputana, and
| Central India. By G. Bühler. Bombay 1877. 8. This is a publication of great importance. Whole branches
| of literature, till then scarcely known, were here brought to light and set forth in a masterly manner. The best
| works published in the Kāvyamālā are printed from MSS. brought by Bühler from this journey, and Sanskrit
| Scholars in Europe have also eagerly availed themselves of them.
| 
| 17. *Ben.* A Catalogue of MSS. in the Library of the Benares Sanskrit College. Published as a
| supplement to the Pandit Voll. III--IX. Benares 1864--74.
| 
| 18. *Lgr.* A descriptive Catalogue of Sanskrit MSS. in the Library of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.
| Part first. Grammar. Edited by Rājendralāla Mitra. Calcutta 1877. 8. Written with more pretence than
| knowledge.
| 
| 19. *Bik.* A Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts in the Library of His Highness the Mahārāja of Bikāner.
| Compiled by Rājendralāla Mitra. Calcutta 1880. 8.
| 
| 20. *Tüb.* Verzeichniss Indischer Handschriften der Königlichen Universitāts-Bibliothek in Tübingen.
| Anhang. Indische Handschriften der Königlichen Oeffentlichen Bibliothek in Stuttgart. Von R. Roth. Tübingen
| 1865. 4.
| 
| 21. *Haug.* Verzeichniss der orientalischen Handschriften aus dem Nachlasse des Professor Dr. Martin
| Haug in München. München 1876. 4. This Catalogue was hastily compiled by Dr. Georg Orterer.
| 
| 22. *Kāṭm.* List of Sanskrit works supposed by the Nepalese Pandits to be rare in the Napalese
| Libraries at Khatmandoo. 14 pages in 8, signed R. Lawrence, Resident. Nepal Residency, The 2nd of
| August, 1868.
| 
| 23. *Pheh.* Phehariçt Saṃskṛitake Pustakon̄kā, 16 pages in 8, without any further statement.
| 
| 24. *Rādh.* Pustakānāṃ Sūcīpatram. 48 pages in 8. At the end we find: likhitaṃ Paṇḍitarājārāma-
| çāstriṇā Kāçmīravāsinā. This important collection of MSS. belonged to the late Paṇḍit Rādhākṛishṇa of Lahore,
| who was famous not only for his enlightened views, but also for his great knowledge of Sanskrit lore.
| 
| 25. *NW.* A Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts in Private Libraries of the North-West Provinces.
| Part I. Benares 1874. 8.
| 
| 26. *Oudh* 1876. 1877. List of Sanskrit Manuscripts discovered in Oudh during the year 1876.
| Prepared by John C. Nesfield, assisted by Pandit Devīprasāda. Calcutta 1878. 8. List of Sanskrit Manuscripts
| discovered in Oudh during the year 1877. Prepared by Pandit Devīprasāda. Allahabad 1878. 8.
| 
| 27. *Oudh.* Catalogue of Sanskrit MSS. existing in Oudh. Compiled by Paṇḍit Devīprasāda. Fascicles
| III--XIII. Subsequent numbers for 1881 (XIV), 1882 (XV), 1883 (XVI), 1884 (XVII), 1885 (XVIII), 1887 (XIX).
| 1888 published in 1890 (XX). 4.
| 
| 28. *NP.* A Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts in Private Libraries of the North-Western Provinces.
| Parts I--X. Allahabad 1877--86. 8.
| 
| 29. *Brl.* Catalogue of a collection of Sanskrit Manuscripts by A. C. Burnell. Part I. Vedic Manuscripts.
| London 1870. 8. These MSS. were presented to the India Office, London.
| 
| 30. *Burnell.* A classified Index to the Sanskrit MSS. in the Palace at Tanjore, by A. C. Burnell.
| London 1880. 8. Any work proceeding from the pen of such a scholar as Burnell may be presumed to be 
| excellent. We only regret in this Catalogue that the author has comparatively rarely given the beginnings of
| the works he has described.
| 
| 31. *Bl.* Report on Sanskrit MSS. 1872--73. Seven, and seventeen pages. Bombay 1874. 8.
|

| 
| 36. *Bh.* A Report on 122 MSS. by R. G. Bhandarkar. Dated Bombay, 7th July 1880. 37 pages
| in folio. This short but precise list can serve as a model for any catalogue, and it is a matter of regret that
| we do not possess many more like it.--Quoted by numbers.
| 
| 37. *P.* Lists of the Sanskrit manuscripts purchased for Government during the years 1877--78 and
| 1869--78, and a list of the manuscripts purchased from May to November 1881. By F. Kielhorn. Dated Poona,
| 30th November 1881. 26 pages in folio.

| Oct. to December 1880. 3) for year 1880--81. 4) for quarter April to June 1881. By Pandit Kāshi Nāth Kunte.
| Lahore, 77 pages in folio.
| 
| 42. *Lahore* 1882. Statement showing the old and rare Manuscripts in Gujranwala and Delhi Districts,
| Punjab, examined during the year 1881--82 by Pandit Kāshi Nāth Kunte. 4 pages of preface, and 12 pages
| of text, in folio. This repeats to some extent the description of MSS. given in the preceding list.
| 
| 43. *Bonn.* Catalogi Librorum Manu scriptorum Orientalium a Ioanne Gildemeistero adornati Fasciculus VII.
| Bonnae 1876. 4.
|

| Manuscripts in the Library of the Board of Examiners, by T. S. Condaswami Jyer. Madras 1861. 8. 
| 
| 48. *Oppert.* Lists of Sanskrit Manuscripts in Private Libraries of Southern India by Gustav Oppert.
| Vol. I. Madras 1880. 4. Vol. II. Madras 1885. 8. No German should have lent his name to such bad
| workmanship.
| 
| 49. *Rice.* Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts in Mysore and Coorg. By Lewis Rice. Banglore 1884.
| 8. More trustworthy than the preceding work, it is done in the same unsatisfactory manner.
| 
| 50. *Peters.* From these we turn with pleasure to three volumes published by Professor Peterson.
| I. Detailed Report of operations in search of Sanskrit Mss. in the Bombay Circle. August 1882--March 1883.--

| 
| 54. *SB.* Catalogue of Sanskrit Mss. in the Sanskrit College Library, Benares. Allahabad. 8. Received
| by me on the 20th of May 1889. This gives a more correct and more complete list than that printed in
| the Pandit.
| 
| 55. *D.* A Catalogue of the Collections of Manuscripts deposited in the Deccan College. By Shridhar
| R. Bhandarkar. Bombay 1888. 8. This is a useful reprint of 18 previously published lists, only the first out
| of 19 being new. A careful index enhances the value of this volume.
| 
| 56. *Sūcīpattra.* Thus I have by mistake called the Sūcīpustaka which contains a list of the MSS. of
| Fort William, the Asiatic Society in Calcutta, etc. Calcutta 1838. 8.
| 
| While writing this, I received the 20th part of the Catalogue of Oudh MSS., and the first part of the
| 10th volume of Rājendralāla Mitra's Notices. Not wishing to encumber the Additions, I must leave these two books
| and any other materials which may hereafter be published for a later opportunity.
| 
| The abbreviations used are for the most part quite clear. an. anonymous, dh. dharma, fr. fragmentary,
| gr. grammatical, ny. nyāya, tantr. tantric. Skm. is the Sūktikarṇāmṛita by Çrīdharadāsa, of which I have copied
| the only two MSS. which hitherto have been discovered. Sbhv. is the Subhāshitāvali by Vallabhadeva. With Çp.
| I refer to my analysis of the Çārn̄gadharapaddhati in Vol. 27 (1873) of the Zeitschrift of the German Oriental
| Society, with Rāyamukuṭa to my Paper on his Padacandrikā, ibid. Vol. 28 (1874) p. 109.

| The Secretary of State for India has supported the present undertaking by a grant of L. 120. The
| German Oriental Society has generously undertaken to publish at its own expense a work which originally was
| calculated not to exceed much beyond thirty sheets.
| 
| There remains only the pleasing duty to thank those Gentlemen who were always ready to answer any

| in Calcutta, Dr. Klatt in Berlin, Professor E. Kuhn in Munich, Dr. R. Rost in London.

| A number of Catalogues and Lists of Sanskrit Manuscripts having appeared since 1891, I was induced
| to publish a second volume of my Catalogus Catalogorum, hoping it will prove as useful as the first. These two
| volumes contain the bulk of Sanskrit works from all parts of India. Of course new discoveries will be made in
| time, and accurate descriptions will correct many of the entries. In the present state of our knowledge of Sanskrit
| Literature mere lists of names are of little value, and lead only to confusion. We require an accurate statement
| of the contents of a work, its author and his parentage, and when possible the year of its composition. This has
| been done in the best Catalogues we possess. The Catalogues extracted in this second volume are the following.
| 
| 1. *ASB.* Journal of Asiatic Society of Bengal.
| 
| 2. *Bhau Dāji.* Catalogue of Manuscripts and Books belonging to the Bhau Dāji Memorial. Bombay

| 
| A number of Catalogues and Lists of Sanskrit Manuscripts having appeared since 1891, I was induced
| to publish a second volume of my Catalogus Catalogorum, hoping it will prove as useful as the first. These two
| volumes contain the bulk of Sanskrit works from all parts of India. Of course new discoveries will be made in
| time, and accurate descriptions will correct many of the entries. In the present state of our knowledge of Sanskrit
| Literature mere lists of names are of little value, and lead only to confusion. We require an accurate statement
| of the contents of a work, its author and his parentage, and when possible the year of its composition. This has
| been done in the best Catalogues we possess. The Catalogues extracted in this second volume are the following.
| 
| 1. *ASB.* Journal of Asiatic Society of Bengal.
| 
| 2. *Bhau Dāji.* Catalogue of Manuscripts and Books belonging to the Bhau Dāji Memorial. Bombay
| 1882. 8^0. Quoted according to pages.--This is a mere list, arranged according to the number of MSS. I
| give a specimen.

| Piṭhorī-Vrata | Vyāsa | Purāṇa | 2 to 7.
