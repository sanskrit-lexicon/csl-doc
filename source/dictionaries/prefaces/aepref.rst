Publisher's Preface to the Third Edition
----------------------------------------


| In preparing this edition, extreme care has been taken to
| make a thorough revision of the book, the main features of
| which are:--

| (a) Over a thousand new words frequently occurring in
| the English literature but not given in the previous editions
| have now been added with their appropriate Sanskrit
| equivalents.

| (b) In some cases, Sanskrit equivalents of words in senses
| other than those given in the earlier editions have been supplied.

| (c) Words similar in form but different in sense, and also
| their derivatives were mixed up in the earlier editions to save
| space. But as this was found to interfere greatly with clear-
| ness and facility of reference they have now been separately
| given in some cases to remedy the inconvenience.

| (d) The feminine forms of adjectives ending in त्, न्, and
| स् which are regularly formed by the simple addition of ई were
| given in the previous editions in the case of the first three
| letters, and then discontinued. They have now been deleted
| throughout.

| In making these changes, the original plan of the learned
| author has been strictly followed.

| These additions and alterations will be found to have con-
| siderably added to the usefulness of the book, and it is hoped that
| in its present form, it will be more helpful to the student world.

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION
---------------------------------


| When I prepared “The Student's Hand-Book of Progressive
| Exercises,” Part II., I thought of adding to it a glossary of
| difficult words and expressions in the Exercises. When this
| was done, an idea occurred that the Glossary should be made
| to include all words of ordinary occurrence, such as are given
| in small School-Dictionaries. When the revision of the sheets
| thus written out commenced, and when they were put to a
| practical test, it was found that several words and expressions
| had still been left out. I, then, resolved to prepare an English-
| Sanskrit Dictionary as complete as possible, and the following
| pages are the result. The Dictionary has thus passed through
| different stages, and has assumed this form, far exceeding the
| limits which I had first assigned to it.

| Much need not, I think, be said with regard to the necessity
| of a work like this. In these days of literary activity, when
| the attention of students is drawn more and more to the study
| of Sanskrit, it is necessary that all appliances should be ready
| before them to facilitate this study. There are one or two
| small Sanskrit-English Dictionaries, though not quite adequate
| to meet the wants of advanced students of Sanskrit, but there
| is no English-Sanskrit Dictionary such as will be within their
| easy reach. The Dictionaries of this description that I know
| of, are two in number:-one by Professor Monier Williams, and
| another by Mr. Anundoram Borooah of Calcutta. Both these
| Dictionaries, though valuable in themselves, are not accesible
| to the student, the prices being prohibitively high. But there
| are other considerations which make these works not quite
| adapted to his wants. Professor Monier Williams' Dictionary,
| having been compiled nearly 35 years ago, chiefly by inverting
| the then existing Sanskrit-English Dictionaries, is naturally
| open to the fault of being often not *practical.* As he says in
| the Preface to his Dictionary, he proceeded to translate
| Webster's Dictionary systematically into Sanskrit, omitting
| words, phrases &c. of which no classical equivalent could be
| found or suggested. The result has been that many of his
| synonyms appear more as coined words than classical expres-
| sions used by standard Sanskrit authors. With regard to words
| collected in Lexicons, such as Amarakosha, Medini, Sabdakal-
| padruma, there is no difficulty; but in the case of those words
| and expressions which can only be suggested by a careful study
| of the usage of the best authors, the work, in my humble opin-
| ion, falls short of one's expectations. Mr. Anundoram Borooah's
| work is eminently *practical:* it abounds with quotations from
| several standard authors; the renderings are generally happy,
| and the work has, at least, a classical appearance. The
| fondness for giving quotations has induced the writer to give
| several quotations for illustrating such words as गम, इति, तत्र, वद
| &c., of the meanings of which there is no doubt nor is any
| confirmation needed. But one great defect of his otherwise
| very useful work is that it gives too few equivalents. He has
| pursued the course of referring one word to another, but
| this is, in some cases, carried to such an extent, that
| when a word, as directed, is referred to another, that
| again is referred to some other word of a synonymous
| nature, which in its turn is referred to another till the
| reader returns to the original word, apparently without
| having his labours rewarded. A study of Mr. Borooah's work
| is a good treat for an advanced Sanskrit scholar, but will not,
| I believe, satisfy the student. From considerations like these
| I thought I should be doing some service to the Sanskrit read-
| ing public, if I compiled an English-Sanskrit Dictionary
| adapted to the wants of the student. The foregoing remarks
| are made not with the view of detracting from the high and
| acknowledged merits of the two works but solely to indicate
| the line I have followed, and the object I have had in compil-
| ing this work.

| Some words are now necessary as to the plan and scope of
| the Dictionary. When I resolved to make this Dictionary as
| complete as possible, consistently with its aim of being useful
| for the student, I took the latest edition of Webster's Complete
| Dictionary, and taking that as my basis, proceeded with the
| work of compilation. As I advanced, I found that several
| words, phrases and expressions and several senses of single
| words, could not be adeqately represented in Sanskrit, so as to
| appear like Sanskrit, either because the words &c. were purely
| technical and referred to specific ideas in subjects, such as
| Chemistry, Botany, Medicine, Psychology, Law, Engineering
| &c., or were such as had no corresponding ideas in Sanskrit and
| were peculiar to the English language. Words of this nature
| are numerous in Webster's Dictionary, and I have omitted
| them, including also obsolete and rare words or senses of words.
| Several words of obvious signification, such as those formed
| by the prefixes’ *‘in,’ ‘mis,’ ‘pre,’ ‘un,’* are also omitted, as
| they may be easily formed from their second member. But the
| general terms of all sciences have been included, and of
| technical terms such as could be duly represented by Sanskrit
| equivalents actually existing in the language or by short,
| wieldy new combinations of words have been inserted. Of
| this description are words like Telegram, Democrat, Society,
| Literature, Address (of a letter) and several other words which
| have a peculiar sense in English and have to be translated by
| inventing equivalents. English. like many other languages, has
| so many expressions and idioms peculiar to itself, so many shades
| and nice distinctions of meaning, and so many new formations
| of words, progressing with the progress of the language, that it
| would be impossible to embrace them all in an English-Sanskrit
| Dictionary, even if it were the most comprehensive work, much
| more so, in a work designed principally for students. Take the
| words Line, Pass, Strong. Webster gives 21 senses under
| ‘Line,’ 13 under ‘Pass (*v. i.*)’ and 20 under ‘Strong.’ Some
| of these are technica’ and some are not *different* senses as
| such, but shades of meaning or particularities of use; most of
| which may be translated by the words given for the general
| sense, (*see* the words)’. I have not thought it desirable, like
| Professor Monier Williams, to insert words the English
| explanation of which has to be systematically translated, in
| order to give some idea of their meaning. ‘Indian-rubber’ is
| translated by अतिस्थितिस्थापकविशिष्टो भारतदेशीयवृक्षनिर्यासः; ‘Shuttle cock’
| by लघुगुलिकाविशेषः यो विनोदार्थं दंडाहतो भूत्वा इतस्ततः प्रक्षिप्यतेः and many
| others of this nature, which can be translated by विशेषः ‘a kind
| of tree, flower, fruit’ &c. Such words may be retained by the
| student in their English form, or their meaning may be
| translated if he desire to have them in a Sanskrit garb. स्पंजः
| ‘Sponge,’ द्युकः ‘Duke,’ सावनं ‘Soap,’ लाटिनं ‘Latinity’ (as given
| by Mr. Borooah) may, I think, be very safely omitted even in
| a comprehensive Dictionary.

| To turn now to the plan and arrangement of the work.
| The most striking feature of the arrangement is that a
| word in its different parts of speech, compound words
| derived from it, derivatives formed from it either regularly,
| by means of terminations (*e. g.* ed, ing, ly, ness &c.)
| or irregularly, have been given together, the derivatives be-
| ing arranged in order under the root or primitive word,
| by means of small black dashes. The dashes are
| intended to at once strike the eye and to direct it to the
| word after it; and when the “directions to the student” are
| remembered, there will, I believe, be no difficulty in referring
| words to the Dictionary. The principle of the arrangement is
| to give words according to the root-system; words regularly
| derived will, of course, be referred in their proper places; but
| words formed from the radical irregularly should also be refer-
| red under that radical. ‘Abstemious’ should be referred under
| ‘Abstain,’ ‘Perception’ under ‘Perceive, ‘Death,’ ‘Dead,’
| under ‘Die,’ ‘Strength’ &c., under ‘Strong,’ ‘Would,’ under
| ‘Will,’ and so on; where it is not likely for the student to
| know where such words are given, reference is made to those
| places; *e. g.* see Material, Sight. One of the greatest advant-
| ages of the system has been practically, (whatever it may be
| theoretically) to effect a very large saving of space. To give
| the reader an idea of the vast saving effected by this system,
| it may be stated that, if the words in their different parts of
| speech and their compounds and derivatives were separately
| given, as in Monier Williams’ Dictionary, they would cover
| nearly 800 pages of this size, or 1, 000 of the size, style of print-
| ing, &c. of Monier Williams’ Dictionary. Besides, by giving
| the words ‘Dead’ ‘Death’ under ‘Die,’ a considerable
| repetition of words is avoided. About 20 equivalents are given
| for ‘Die,’ and only a few are given for ‘Dead’; the rest can be
| formed in the same way from the roots immediately above; if it
| were given in its usual place, all words would have to be given
| or a reference made to ‘Die.’ My chief aim has been to give a
| good deal of matter in a small space, and this object is, I
| believe, considerably secured, as shown by the figures given
| above; and I have thus been enabled to give this book to the
| public at a cheap price.

| The next point to be noticed is the number of equivalents
| that are given for a word. I believe that in an English-
| Sanskrit Dictionary, it is sufficient to give such words only as
| are of very frequent occurrence in Sanskrit authors. It cannot
| include all words in the language, and even if it could, it
| would be of no great use, since many of the words would be
| found to be very rarely used. The word ‘Gold’ has over 50
| synonyms given for it in the different lexicons; ‘Sun’ has
| nearly a hundred. But it will easily be seen that, excepting
| some, the synonyms are either combinations of simple words,
| or are descriptive epithets. Of this class are the words
| वक्रपुच्छः, ललजिव्हः, रात्रिजागरः, for ‘Dog.’ Mr. Borooah in his
| Dictionary has given only a few equivalents, in some instances,
| only one, where there were 5 most commonly used; Prof.
| Williams has very often given too many equivalents, grouping
| together common and rare, synonyms proper and epithets. In
| the former case the student will hardly have any room left for
| choosing his word, while in the latter, he will be at a loss to
| see which to choose. In giving equivalents in this Dictionary,
| whether for Substantives, Adjectives, Adverbs or Verbs, I have
| endeavoured to strike a middle course between these two
| courses, and, have kept one principle steadily in view: to give
| such words as are found frequently used in the works of
| standard authors. The equivalents are arranged in the order
| of their frequency of use; and the student, in his ordinary
| prose composition, would do well to make his selection from
| the first few equivalents enumerated. In the case of Verbs it
| has not been possible to maintain this principle with perfect
| accuracy in every case, but it is generally maintained. It is
| only in a few cases of substantives that I have gone the length
| of giving all words enumerated in the Amarakosha; and in the
| case of names of material substances, names of plants and
| trees that have been identified, and in a few others, all the
| words given in the Amarakosha have been here incorporated,
| care being taken to arrange them in the order of their useful-
| ness. Similarly such Genders, Padas or Conjugations are
| given as will be found generally used; I have very rarely given
| all possible ones. It has not been thought necessary to give the
| 3rd person singular, Present tense, nor all possible derivatives
| from simple words; they will have, if necessary, to be made up
| according to the “Directions” afterwards given. In giving
| equivalents for a word in its different senses, it has also not
| been thought necessary to give the meanings in English, except
| where it was necessary to note a particular sense. One word
| in Sanskrit often represents several meanings in English, and
| to render them into Sanskrit, the Sanskrit word has to be
| repeated. This accounts for the repetition of some Sanskrit
| words under different meanings.

| In will be noticed that there are several sentences given to
| illustrate the meanings of words, some of which are quotations
| from standard authors, as will be readily seen from the
| references given after them; but many of the phrases and
| sentences that are translated, and are not supported by any
| authority, are taken from the “Student's Hand-Book of
| Progressive Exercises,” Part II. I deemed it essential to illust-
| rate, in some cases at least, the *construction* of the equivalents
| given, wherever it was peculiar in Sanskrit; and I thought I
| could do this better if I gave sentences from classical authors
| instead of framing them myself. The quotations have become
| quite necessary in those cases where equivalents have been
| here suggested for the first time; I thought I should produce my
| vouchers for a particular word that I suggested rather than
| leave the reader in doubt as to its genuineness. In a few cases the
| English or Sanskrit sentences are closely translated; in a few
| others only such parts of the Sanskrit sentences are translated
| as are sufficient to illustrate the word intended to be illustrat-
| ed, while in several cases, Sanskrit sentences alone are given
| which might be readily understood by the student. On a reference
| to the names of works or authors drawn upon for quotations,
| it will be found that the list is not very comprehensive; several
| large and useful works have been left out, and works falling
| in the range of classical literature excluded. But my principal
| aim in giving quotations has been to supply the student with
| good expressions from works *within his easy reach* so that he might
| study, if necessary. the particular places referred to. Kalidasa's
| works and Bana's Kadambari are more frequently drawn upon
| than the Ramayana, the Mahabhharata, the Naishadha or the
| Mahâvîracharita.

| An attempt has been made to avoid as much unneccessary
| repetition as was possible, without marring the usefulness of
| the work. A Dictionary is necessarily a work of repetition;
| several words have to be unavoidably repeated, howsoever un-
| willing one might be to do so. I have thought it necessary to
| make reference under some words to preceding or succeeding
| parts of the Dictionary, chiefly with the view of avoiding
| repetition; but in such cases a few equivalents are given, and
| the student is told to follow out the reference, if he want to
| know more about the word. Take, for instance, the words,
| Beguile, Cheat, Deceive, Delude, Defraud, Impose upon, Take
| in; or Blame, Censure, Reprove, Reproach, Scold, Reprimand,
| Reprehend; or Path, Road, Way: these words, whatever be their
| shades of meaning in English, are, when represented in
| Sanskrit, almost synonymous, and may be conveniently
| represented by the same words. If ten or fifteen equivalents
| under one of these words, say, Cheat, Censure, or Way, are
| given, it would be unnecessary to repeat all of them again
| under the synonymous words. In all such cases, therefore,
| references have been made to some general word under which
| are given all the equivalents. In a few cases the reference has
| been made, not for any equivalents, but for any expressions,
| phrases, idioms &c. that may have been given under the
| principal word. In no case will the student have to refer to
| the Dictionary *more than twice.*

| In a work which professes to deal with the phrases and
| expressions of the English Language, the writer cannot afford
| to disregard the several small useful proverbs, mottoes, or other
| expressions which have become proverbial. I have, with this
| view, inserted, under some principal word therein, such
| proverbs &c., and have given exact or approximate equivalents,
| wherever they existed in Sanskrit, and have in a few cases
| given my own translation of them. Of this nature are proverbs
| given under Bush, Handsome, Make, Oil, Race, Something,
| Suffer, Touch &c.

| With regard to the method of writing the Sanskrit equival-
| ents, an objection might possibly be raised. Throughout the
| work the usual practice of representing every anusvara in the
| body of a word by its corresponding nasals has been rejected
| and the anusvara sign is invariably used, where usually a
| nasal would stand. I have not been able to understand the
| principle on which scholars reject this system and betake
| themselves solely to the other; though the anusvara system is
| most convenient in printing, and occasionally saves much
| misunderstanding. Besides, it is a practice generally followed
| in our old Manuscripts, and is sanctioned by Panini as being
| optional. For these reasons I have scrupulously followed it in
| this Dictionary, but more especially because it is very conveni-
| ent in printing. The rules of Sandhi, to make the words
| clearly intelligible, are not in all cases strictly observed.

| It now remains for me to do the grateful duty of acknow-
| ledging my obligations to those that have assisted me in the
| preparation of the Dictionary in one form or another.
| Foremost among them stand the works of Mr. Borooah and
| Prof. Williams, both of which I have most frequently consult-
| ed. Monier Williams’ Dictionary, though inferior in several
| respects to Mr. Borooah's, has several happy renderings of
| short words and expressions, especially where ideas, purely
| English, have to be clothed in a Sanskrit garb, and I have freely
| consulted his Dictionary for such renderings. I have also
| frequently referred to the learned Professor's valuable Sanskrit-
| English Dictionary; for both of which my sincere thanks are
| due to him. But my acknowledgments are chiefly due to Mr.
| Borooah, from whose work I have derived much substantial
| assistance, in the suggestion of equivalents for words or
| phrases, more particularly from his numerous quotations, and
| therein again, quotations from such works as were not
| accessible to me, or being accessible, I had no time at my
| disposal sufficient to go through them. I have also had to
| keep constantly by my side, the useful Sanskrit Lexicon -- the
| Kosha of Amarasimha -- made more useful by the edition
| published by the Department of Public Instruction, Bombay.
| In giving illustrative sentences from classical Authors, I have
| used annotations or translations wherever they existed, and
| have derived hints from them and have occasionally adopted
| their translation. My thanks are due to all annotators, editors
| or translators of such works. I have to thank sincerely Prof.
| R. G. Bhandarkar, M. A. Deccan College, Poona, who kindly
| proposed suitable equivalents for some difficult words and
| phrases which were referred to him. I have also to thank my
| friend, Mr. Ganesh Krishna Garde. L. M. & S., for having
| supplied me with accurate equivalents for some knotty and
| technical terms in Medicine, from books and sources which
| I had no time to reach, and which even if I had time to reach
| and use, I could not, unaided by him, turn to much practical
| account. Lastly, my thanks are due to several kind and
| obliging friends who assisted me either in collecting materials
| for the Dictionary, or in carrying it through the Press.

| In conclusion, I trust that the Dictionary will be useful
| not only to those for whose use it is principally prepared, but
| to the general public also who may wish to avail themselves
| of appliances calculated to help the study of Sanskrit. It is
| my belief that, except for the translation of passages from
| purely technical subjects, such as Chemistry, Botany, Medicine,
| Philosophy etc., this Dictionary will be useful to all readers of
| Sanskrit for translating any passage dealing with ordinary
| subjects. None is more conscious than myself of the defects
| of the book, and of the mistakes or inaccuracies that might
| have crept into it, in spite of my vigilance; and when a second
| edition is prepared, I shall endeavour, to the best of my ability,
| to make the Dictionary complete in itself. I shall be very
| happy to receive any suggestions that readers may have to
| make and shall be but too willing to adopt them, if I find them
| useful. With these prefatory remarks I leave the work to the
| indulgent judgment of the public.

PUBLISHER'S PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION
-----------------------------------------


| The Publisher had hoped that the learned author would
| write a preface to this Edition; but unfortunately it was not to
| be. He was snatched away suddenly from amongst us by the
| cruel hand of death to the sincere regret of all lovers of Sanskrit
| learning. Therefore the present edition has had to suffer
| along with other works of his, the want of his finishing touch.
| However it is in some respects a consolation to think that Mr.
| Apte found time before his death to go carefully through the
| first Edition and to make the necessary corrections in it in the
| light of his riper studies.

DIRECTIONS TO THE STUDENT
-------------------------

| (TO BE STUDIED BEFORE USING THE DICTIONARY.)

| 1. Words and their derivatives are arranged in the follow-
| ing order: first the radical or primitive word, in all its different
| parts of speech; then compound words, arranged in alphabetical
| order; (in the case of verbs, such words as Break off, Turn out,
| are given as -off, -out); and then the derivatives which are
| always distinguished by a black dash; those formed regularly
| being given first, and the irregular ones, written fully, after
| them (*see* Ambition, Humble, Young.)

| *Note.* -- This order is not regularly observed in the first
| three letters, compound words and derivatives being, in a few
| cases, both distinguished by black dashes.

| 2. In giving the terminations by which derivatives are
| formed, the changes which the final and initial letters undergo,
| *e. g.* the dropping, doubling or assimilation of letters are as-
| sumed; the terminations being always given in their original
| form; *see* Cut, Hurry, Mature.

| 3. (*a*) A small black dash (-) marks the commencement
| of a new derivative. (*b*) A word preceded by a large black
| dash (-) indicates that the derivatives given after it, are from
| that word and *not* from the radical or primitive word; *see* Die,
| Dead. (*c*) A hyphen used in the middle of Sanskrit words
| indicates that each of the members separated by the hyphen is
| to be repeated with the word after it; or that the word after
| the hyphen is to be taken as an alternative for the word im-
| mediately before it (to be, in some cases, decided by the context),
| *e. g.* in HAVE, *l.* 9, यथाकामं-स्वरुच्या-वृत् means यथाकामं वृत्, स्वरुच्या वृत्; in
| PRACTICE, *l.* 3, नित्यवृत्तिः-चर्या अनुष्ठानं means नित्यवृत्तिः, नित्यचर्या, नित्यानुष्ठानं।
| (*d*) A hyphen followed by a comma (-,) indicates that the
| word after it may stand by itself or may be joined with the
| word before it; *e. g.* in PLACE *l.* 1, प्र-, देशः means the word is either
| देशः or प्रदेशः; (*e*) A comma followed by a hyphen (,-) indicates
| that the word after it may be compounded with the word
| preceding it; *e. g.* in STAGE *l.* 1, रंगः-, शाला means the word is either
| रंगः, or रंगशाला। (*f*) º denotes that the word immediately before it
| which is separated by a comma, may be compounded with the
| words which it connects; *e. g.* PREVENT, *l.* 1 वृ c.. नि-विनि°, means
| the root is also निवृ c. and विनिवृ c.

| 4. In the case of substantives, the nominative case, wherever
| it could at once indicate the gender, has been given; the visarga
| thus indicates masculine gender, and anusvára neuter gender.
| Where the nominative is not indicative of the gender, it is
| given as *m., f., n.,* as the case may be. All substantives ending
| in consonants have their genders specified as *m., f.,* or *n.*

| 5. In the case of adjectives, the simple base only is given.
| The feminine of the majority of adjectives in अ ends in आ, and
| adjectives ending in इ, उ have generally the same base for all
| genders. In all such cases the simple base is given, the genders
| being formed regularly according to similar substantive bases.
| Irregular feminines are denoted in brackets. (*f.*) Bases ending
| in त्, न्, स्, form their feminine regularly in ती, नी, सी,

| 6. (*a*) In the case of verbs, the Arabic figure denotes the
| conjugation to which the root belongs; **P** denoting Parasmaipada,
| **A** Atmanepada, and **U** Ubhayapada (P & A.) Roots of the tenth
| conjugation belong to both Padas, theoretically at least; and
| hence 10 is used for all roots of this conjugation, though the
| Parasmaipada, unless where otherwise specified, should be
| generally preferred for use. (*b*) c. denotes causal, and is form-
| ed from roots by making the same changes as in the
| 10th conjugation. Wherever it cannot be formed by this
| general rule, it is shown in brackets. (*e*) *D.* means Denomina-
| tives; here the 3rd pers. singular Present tense is given
| throughout.

| 7. All the derivatives from a word are not always given
| when they may be easily supplied; more especially, in the case
| of potential passive participles, formed by तव्य, य, अनीय, past
| participles, present participles, verbal nouns, abstract nouns
| from adjectives, and adverbs from adjectives. Where there
| was any peculiarity in the formation of these derivatives,
| they are given; but in many cases the student will have to
| supply the forms, according to rules given in grammars.
