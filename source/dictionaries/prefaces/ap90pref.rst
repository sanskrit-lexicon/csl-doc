PREFACE.

| This Dictionary has been undertaken to supply a want long felt by the student of a complete
| and at the same time cheap Sanskrit-English Dictionary. Very little need, I think, be said with regard
| to the necessity of bringing out a work like this, when the study of Sanskrit has received such a strong
| impetus during the last twenty-five years. There have been four or five Sanskrit-English Dictionaries pub-
| lished till now; but very few of them fulfil the two essential conditions of the popularity and usefulness of
| such works: --satisfying all the requirements of students and at the same time being within their easy reach.
| The Dictionaries of Professors Wilson and Monier Williams are very useful and valuable works, but their
| prices-particularly of the latter-are prohibitively high, and they do not also meet many of the most ordinary
| wants of Sanskrit readers. A student, while reading Sanskrit at School or College, generally expects that the
| Dictionary which he uses will give appropriate equivalents for such words and compound expressions as
| may have peculiar meanings or shades of meaning in particular passages. He desires to know not only that
| a particular word has so many senses, but that it has this or that sense in a particular passage of a
| book, so that he may determine any particular meaning of a word in a certain passage by seeing and
| comparing how it is used elsewhere by the same writer or by other writers in different works. He also
| wants accurate and, as far as possible, full explanations of the more important technical terms occur-
| ring at least in his usual course reading, as well as any other information likely to be of use to him.
| Professor Monier Williams has, in his invaluable Dictionary, tried to exhaust the meanings of words as far as
| he could, and has also given much useful information on some points. But it would not, I think, be detracting
| from the merits of the great work to say that it fails to give some of the most common senses of words occur-
| ring in such well-known and oft-read books as the Uttararâmacharita, Mudrârâkshasa, Veṇîsamhàra,
| \ *S*\ i\ *s*\ upálavadha or Kâdambarî, Moreover it gives neither quotations nor references, nor much of the in-
| formation likely to be useful to the student during his School or College career. In making these re-
| marks I must not, in the slightest degree, be understood to make any reflections on that Dictionary. Indeed, I
| have myself derived no small help from that work, as will be acknowledged further on. My only object
| in pointing out its defects has been to show why I thought it necessary to undertake the compila-
| tion of a new Dictionary, when some already existed in the field, and I hope the reader will be able
| to find that this Dictionary is an improvement on its predecessors in some respects at least.

| Having thus explained the necessity of undertaking and publishing this Dictionary, I shall say a
| few words with regard to its plan and scope. The extent of Sanskrit literature is so vast that not even the
| life-long labours of a single individual, howsoever talented or persevering, will be able to do full justice to it.
| It has two distinct branches, the Vedic and post-Vedic, each of which will require an independent encyclopædia
| for itself. Not even the gigantic \ *Vâchaspatya*\  of the late Professor Târânâtha Tarkavâchaspati, nor the
| equally gigantic German \ *Wörterbuch*\  of Drs. Roth and Bothlingk, can be said to be altogether complete and
| comprehensive. Much less can a small work like mine-complied during the leisure hours
| of a teacher's life-aspire to be called complete in any sense of the word. However, I have
| tried to make it as comprehensive and practically useful to the student of Sanskrit as
| my humble powers enabled me to do, though how far I have succeeded in my object the reader alone can
| best decide. It includes all words occurring in the general post-Vedic literature, such as Epics like
| the Râmâyaṇa and Mahâbhârata, the several Puràṇas, the Smṛiti literature, particularly the law-books of
| Manu and Yâjñavalkya, the several dar\ *s*\ anas or systems of philosophy such as Nyâya, Vai\ *s*\ eshika, Mîmâmsâ,
| Vedânta, &c. Grammar, Rhetoric, Poetry in all its branches, Tantra and dramatic literature, Mathematics,
| Medicine, Astrenemy, Music, and such other technical or scientific branches of learning. It inserts most 
| of the leading names of trees and plants with scientific or vernacular equivalents wherever noteworthy.
| It also gives most of the principal Vedic words or senses of words; for though Vedic Literature would
| require a dictionary by itself, still I did not think it desirable to omit altogether at least such words as fre-
| quently occur, especially as I intended to make this work as complete and comprehensive as I could. For the
| same reason, obscure or unimportant words or senses of words have been inserted, though they may not be
| generally met with in classical literature as studied by the University student.

| The chief feature of this Dictionary is that it has aimed at being \ *practical.*\  With this view I have
| added quotations and references to the peculiar and noteworthy senses of words, especially such as occur in
| works read by the student at School or College. In some cases the quotations might appear to some to
| be superfluous, but to a student, especially a beginner, they are very useful, as they supply him with
| apt illustrations of the senses of words, and enable him to provide himself with a large stock of
| choice, idiomatic expressions which are so abundant in the language. Another noticeable feature of the
| Dictionary is that it gives full explanations of the more important technical terms, particularly in Nyâya,
| Alankâra, Vedânta, Grammar and Dramaturgy, with quotations in Sanskrit wherever necessary; \ *e. g.*\ 
| see the words 
|  &c. In the case of Alankâras I have chiefly drawn upon
| the Kàvyaprakâ\ *s*\ a, though I have occasionally consulted the Rasagangâdhara, Chandrâloka and Kuvala-
| yânanda. In the explanation of dramatic terms I have usually followed the Sâhityadarpaṇa and its
| translation into English, and have sometimes referred to the Da\ *s*\ arūpa. Similarly, striking phrases, some
| choice expressions and idioms or peculiar combinations of words, have been given under every word where
| necessary or possible; \ *e. g.*\  see the words गम्, सेतु, मयूर, हस्त, धा, कृ, दा, बंध्, &c. Mythological allusions
| in the case of all important personages have been briefly but clearly explained, so as to give the reader
| most of the facts connected with them; \ *e. g.*\  see अग्नि, अगस्त्य, इंद्र, कार्तिकेय, प्रह्राद, सावित्री &c. Etymology
| has generally been given in the case of every important word, except where it was purely fanciful; \ *e. g.*\  see
| अजीवनि, अतिथि, अपत्य, पुत्र, जाया, हृषीकेश &c. In doing this I have followed the system of native gramma-
| rians who resolve every word into its \ *‘prakriti’*\  and \ *‘pratyaya’,*\  and the terminations given according to
| Pâṇini's nomenclature will be explained further on. I have thought it necessary to do so at the sugges-
| tion of several friends, and have derived considerable help from the great \ *Váchaspatya*\  which I have
| usually followed, except where the etymology given therein appeared to me to be purely arbitrary or fan-
| ciful. Philological comparisons have been given only where useful and noteworthy. The work also gives in-
| formation about words which, it is believed, will be very useful, especially to the University student; \ *e. g.*\ 
| see the words अप्सरस्, असुर, वेद, मंडल, मानस, हंस &c. Some of the most common \ *Nyâyas*\  or Maxims have
| been collected under the word न्याय for easy reference; \ *e. g.*\  see काकतालीयन्याय, दंडापूपन्याय, स्थालीपुलाकन्याय
| &c. To add to the usefulness of the Dictionary I have added at the end three Appendices. The first is on
| Sanskrit Prosody which attempts to give in a clear and intelligible form all the common metres with Defini-
| tions, Schemes in Gaṇas, and Examples. In the preparation of this Appendix I have chiefly
| drawn upon the two popular works on Prosody, the Vṛittaratnâkara and Chhando-Manjari,
| but some common metres omitted in those works have been added from the illustrations
| found in the works of Mâgha, Bháravi, Daṇḍin, Bha\ *t*\ \ *t*\ i, \ *S*\ u4draka &c. Colebrooke's Essay on Sanskrit Metres
| has also given me occasional help. The second Appendix gives the dates, writings &c. of some of the im-
| portant Sanskrit writers such as Kálidâsa, Bhavabhūtî, Bâṇa. Here I have selected only those names about
| which something definite-something more than mere guesses and surmises-is known, and I have derived
| some hints from the Introduction to Vallabhadeva's Subhâshitávali edited by Dr. Peterson and Pandit
| Durgâ Prasâda, and from Prof. Max Müller's ‘India: what it can teach us,’ for which my thanks are due
| to the authors of both the works. The third Appendix gives the most important names in the
| ancient Geography of India with identifications on the modern map wherever ascertained, and
| in this part of the work I have to cordially acknowledge the help I have derived from Cun-
| ningham's Ancient Geography, but particularly from Mr. Borooah's Essay prefixed to the third
| volume of his English-Sanskrit Dictionary. I had at first intended to add two alphabctical indexes to
| the principal events and personages occurring in the Râmâyaṇa and Mahâbhârata, but I have
| had to abandon the project, as the publication of the Dictionary has already been delayed on account of 
| various causes over which I had no control. In short, I have endeavoured to make the PRACTICAL SAN-
| SKRIT-ENGLISH DICTIONARY as complete, comprehensive, and encyclopedic as was possible within the limits
| of a single compact volume by condensing a very large amount of matter by means of suitable typographi-
| cal and other arrangements, and I hope it will be found to be a practically useful and reliable guide in
| the study of the Sanskrit language.

| There is one point which will not fail to strike a careful reader of this Dictionary, which is that there is
| not the same fulness of treatment in the later portion as in the first 300 or 400 pages. After the vowels
| had been printed off, I found that they covered no less than 364 pages by themselves, and if the remain-
| ing letters of the alphabet had been treated with the same fulness, the volume would have increased to
| about 2000 pages, and the publication of the work itself would have been delayed by at least one year more.
| It is obvious that neither time, nor the very cheap price at which the work was offered to subscribers,
| would have enabled me to carry on the work of compilation on the same scale; and I was, therefore, obliged
| to endeavour to curtail the matter by occasionally substituting references for quotations without at the same
| time marring the usefulness of the work, and by abridging explanations of words and the information given
| about them, while in some cases I have had to keep back matter originally intended for the volume. I hope,
| however, that this has not to any great extent affected the practical usefulness of the Dictionary, and
| I trust that if time and circumstances permit, I shall be in a position to make the second edition much more
| useful, complete, and comprehensive than the first.

| The plan and arrangement of the work will be best understood from the ‘Directions’ which follow.
| Verbs formed by prefixing prepositions to roots are arranged in the alphabetical order of the prepositions so
| affixed; \ *e.g.*\  प्रस्था or संस्था must be looked for not under स्था, but in its own alphabetical order, and at the head
| of its own group of derivatives. This system has been followed in this Dictionary with a view to save re-
| petition of equivalents under the derivatives from a root. But if, on trial, it be found to be practically in-
| convenient, it may be abandoned in the second edition. As in the English-Sanskrit Dictionary, I have
| here throughout used the \ *anusvâra*\  instead of the nasals, (\ *e. g. anga*\  or \ *santâpa*\  is written not as अङ्ग, सन्ताप,
| but as अंग, संताप), which practice, whatever may be said with regard to its correctness, is very convenient for
| purposes of printing. The several contrivances used to effect saving in space will be understood by the
| reader after very short practice.

| It now remains for me to do the grateful duty of acknowledging the help I have derived from differ-
| ent sources. And in doing so I must give the first place to the great Sanskrit encyclopædia, the Vâchas-
| patya of Professor Tárânâtha Tarkavâchaspati. I have constantly kept it by my side and have freely avail-
| ed myself of the information contained in it-of course with large curtailments-though I have had to supple-
| ment it myself wherever it was found to be defective or insufficient. Several words and senses of words not given
| in the existing Sanskrit-English lexicons, as also some quotations, particularly from Udbhaṭa and Puráṇas,
| have been borrowed from the same work. The Sanskrit-English Dictionary of Professor Monier Williams is
| the next work to which I have been greatly indebted. It has been a constant source of help to me, and I
| have frequently adopted his renderings of words, compound expressions &c., where I found them better
| than those I myself had to suggest. And though there is a good deal in this Dictionary that is not to be
| found in that work, and though the plan and scope of the two are essentially different, yet I must
| gratefully acknowledge the great assistance I have often derived from the learned Professor's invaluable Dic-
| tionary. The last work to which also my grateful acknowledgments are due is the German Wörterbuch of
| Drs. Roth and Bothlingk. The chief distinguishing feature of that great work is that it abounds with
| quotations and references dealing with almost every branch of Sanskrit literature, but a careful reader will
| easily see that the works belonging to Vedic literature, such as the four Vedas, Upanishads,
| Brâhmaṇas, \ *A*\ \ raṇyakas &c., have been comparatively more copiously drawn upon by the
| authors than works belonging to the post-Vedic literature. A glance at the contents of this
| Dictionary will show that I have drawn upon works seldom or not at all referred to in the
| Wörterbuch; such as the Mahâvîracharita, Mâlatî-Mâdhava, Uttararâmacharita, Kádambarî, \ *S*\ i\ *s*\ upâla-
| vadha, Kirâtârjunîya, Mudrârâkshasa, Veṇîsamhâra, Ratnâvalî, Kàvyaprakása, \ *S*\ ánkartabhâshya, Bháminîvilása,
| Vikramânkadevacharita, Gangálaharî &c. Indeed, the great majority of quotations and references are 
| from my own collection made during the last seven or eight years; and I have even been obliged to keep back
| a large number of them for want of space. But I must frankly acknowledge that I have freely availed
| myself of the quotations and references in that Dictionary, where my own collection was defective, particularly
| in the case of Vedic and Paurâṇic works. I have also occasionally consulted the Dictionaries of H. H.
| Wilson and Benfey, the former supplying some happy renderings of technical or obscure
| words. To these authors, as well as to the authors and editors of several other works, which are
| too many to be here mentioned, from which I have derived occasional help in one form or another, my
| most grateful thanks are due.

| In conclusion I may be permitted to express the hope that the PRACTICAL SANSKRIT-ENGLISH DICTION-
| ARY-which has attempted to give in 1200 closely printed pages of this size matter at least equal in point of
| \ *quantity*\  to that given by Prof. Monier Williams in his Dictionary, but in point of \ *quality*\  more reliable,
| varied, and practically useful, in my humble opinion-will serve the purpose I have had in view in
| compiling it; namely, to render to the student of Sanskrit nearly the same service that Webster's or Ogilvie's
| Dictionary does to the student of English. I have tried to make it easily accessible to the public by issuing
| a Popular Edition priced at 7 Rupees-a price too low, I believe, for so much matter; while the Library Edi-
| tion which, containing the same matter, is printed on superior paper and in better style, and will also
| have superior binding, will best answer the purposes of the well-to-do persons who can afford to
| spend 10 or 11 Rupees for such object. In a work of this kind I know there must be several de-
| fects and also errors both of omission and commission, and if such persons as will do me the honour of using
| this Dictionary will be so good as to point out to me places which require corrections, additions or improve-
| ments, I shall be very happy to give the suggestions my best consideration in the second edition. But if
| the Dictionary, even in its present form, be found to be a useful publication, I shall consider my labours
| more than amply repaid, and shall feel quite refreshed to devote my humble self again, if need be, to
| the service of the Sanskrit-reading public; for, says the poet,
| क्लेशः फलेन हि पुनर्नवतां विधत्ते।

DIRECTIONS TO BE STUDIED BEFORE USING THIS DICTIONARY.
------------------------------------------------------


| 1. Words and their derivatives are arranged in the following order: first the \ *radical*\  or primitive
| word in large black type in all its different parts of speech; and then the several derivatives in smaller type.
| In some cases these derivatives are given in their own alphabetical order for the sake of clearness.

| 2. The different parts of speech of a word are indicated by large black dashes, after which the nomi-
| native singular of the part of speech is usually given, or the letters \ *m., f., n.*\  or \ *ind.*\  are put after the dash, the
| leading word being given only once. Where a word is used as an adjective and also as a substantive, the
| senses of the adjective are invariably given first; \ *e. g.*\  वीर, साधु, सत्। The same is done in the case of com-
| pounds, but within brackets.

| 3. Where two words, though identical in form, differ entirely in meaning, they are generally repeated
| as separate words; \ *e. g.*\  हा, हि। In a few cases they have been grouped together.

| 4. Words which are used as adverbs, but derived by case-inflections from a noun or adjective, are
| given under the noun or adjective, \ *e. g.*\  उत्तरेण under उत्तर। In some cases they are given within
| brackets before the compounds, if any.

| 5. The several meanings of a word, where they can be sufficiently distinguished from one another, are
| given separately and marked by black Arabic figures. Mere \ *shades*\  of meaning are not considered as separate
| senses, but in such cases several synonyms are given under the same meaning, from which the reader will
| have to make his choice. Where the shades of meaning are sufficiently broad, they are numbered as separate
| meanings.

| 6. The meanings of words are arranged in the order of their importance and frequency of use. It has
| not, of course, been possible to do so in \ *every*\  case, ut the system has been generally followed.

| 7. (\ *a*\ ) Compounds are grouped under the first word in the compounds, in the alphabetical order of
| their \ *second*\  members, the black dash before them denoting that first word; \ *e, g.*\  --होत्र under अग्नि means 
|  under उत्तर means उत्तराधिकारिन्।

| \ *N. B.*\  In giving compounds, the changes, which the final letters undergo, \ *e. g.*\  the dropping, assimila-
| tion of letters &c. are assumed; \ *e. g.*\  --अपर under पूर्व stands for पूर्वापर, --गतिः under अधस्, for अधोगतिः &c. In
| some cases the compound words, where not easily intelligible, are given in full within brackets; see 
|  &c.

| (\ *b*\ ) Where a compound itself is used as the first member of other compounds, these letter are given
| immediately after, their second member being preceded by ºwhich represents the first compound; \ *e. g.*\  
|  &c. given under द्वि stand not for द्वींद्र or द्विराज, but for द्विजेंद्र or द्विजराज।

| (\ *c*\ ) All \ *aluk*\  compounds (\ *e. g.*\  आत्मनेपद, कुशेशय, परस्मैपद, मनसिज, दास्याः पुत्रः, हृदिस्पृश् &c.) are
| given separately in their proper places, but under the radical word.

| 8. All words formed by Kṛit or Taddhita affixes are given separately; thus 
|  &c. will be found not as compounds under कूल, भय &c. but as separate words. 

| 9. (\ *a*\ ). In the case of substantives the nominative singular, wherever it may at once denote the
| gender, is given throughout, the \ *visarga,*\  unless followed by \ *f.,*\  indicating masculine gender, and the
| \ *anusvâra*\  neuter gender. Where the nominative singular is not indicative of the gender, it is specified as
| \ *m. f.*\  or \ *n.*\  as the case may be. All substantives ending in consonants have their genders specified as \ *m. f.*\ 
| or \ *n.*\ 

| (\ *b*\ ) The feminine forms of nouns are usually given as separate leading words, but in some cases,
| especially in the first five or six hundred pages, they are given under the leading word after the masculine
| gender. But where the fem. base enters into compounds, it is invariably given separately; \ *e. g.*\  अजा।

| 10. In the case of adjectives the simple base only is given. The feminine of the majority of adjec-
| tives in अ ends in आ, and adjectives ending in इ or उ have generally the same base for all genders. In all
| such cases the simple base is given, the feminine being formed according to similar substantive bases. All
| irregular feminines are, however, denoted within brackets. Adjectives ending in त्, न्, or स्, form their
| feminines regularly in ती, नी, or सी; where irregular, they are denoted within brackets.

| 11. (\ *a*\ ). In the case of verbs, the Arabic figure before P., A. and U. denotes the conjugation
| to which the root belongs; P. denoting Parasmaipada, A. Atmanepada, and U. Ubhayapada (P. and A.).
| Den. stands for Denominative, and here the 3rd pers. sing. present tense is given throughout.

| (\ *b*\ ). Under each root the 3rd person singular present tense and of the Perfect, Aorist, two Futures
| and Infinitive in the case of important roots, and the past passive participle wherever noteworthy, are given
| throughout. The forms of the \ *Passive, Causal*\  and \ *Desiderative,*\  wherever noteworthy, are given after them,
| or after the senses of the primitive base, where there is any peculiarity in their senses.

| (\ *c*\ ). Verbs formed by prefixing prepositions to roots are given separately in their own alphabetical
| order, except in cases where there are no derivatives from such verbs.

| (\ *d*\ ). Roots sometimes change their form or \ *pada*\  (voice) or both, when used in particular senses,
| or when preceded by particular prepositions. Such changes are denoted within brackets.

| (\ *e*\ ). When a root belongs to different conjugations with different meanings, Roman figures are used
| to mark this difference, (cf. अस्, गुप्, हा &c.), the root being repeated only once.

| 12. (\ *a*\ ). All possible derivatives from a word are not always given when they may be easily sup-
| plied, more especially in the case of potential passive participles (formed by तव्य, अनीय and य), present
| participles, and abstract nouns from adjectives (formed by adding ता, त्व or य). Where there is any pecu-
| liarity either in the formation or meaning of these derivatives, they are given. But in many cases the stu-
| dent will have to supply the forms according to the general rules given in Grammar.

| (\ *b*\ ). Similarly all the equivalents given under the radical word are not always repeated under the deri-
| vatives; they may, if necessary, be ascertained by a reference to the radical word.

| 13. Mythological allusions are explained in \ *small*\  type in the body of the work between rectangular
| brackets []. Here long vowels like â, î, ū, and letters of the lingual class, as also ऋ and श are, for the
| convenience of the press, denoted by corresponding \ *italic*\  letters; \ *e. g.*\  P\ \ *and*\ \ ava and K\ \ *ri*\ \ p\ \ *i*\  stand for
| पांडव and कृपी।

| 14. Metres and information about literary and geographical names are given in the Appendices at
| the end. 

EXPLANATION OF TERMINATIONS USED IN THE DERIVATION OF WORDS.
