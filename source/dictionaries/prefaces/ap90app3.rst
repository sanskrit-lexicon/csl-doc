APPENDIX III. Geographical names
--------------------------------

| On important Geographical names in ancient India.

| अंग¦ N. of an important kingdom situated on the right
| bank of the Ganges. Its capital was Champâ, also
| called Angapurî. This town stood on the Ganges
| about 24 miles west of a rocky island, and is, there-
| fore, considered to be the same as, or situated very
| near, the modern Bhágalpur.

| अंध्र¦ N. of a people and their country. It is said to be
| the same as the modren Telangaṇa, and the
| mouths of the Godâvarî were in the possession of
| the Andhras. But the limits were probably con-
| fined to the Ghâts on the west, and the rivers
| Godâvarî and Kṛishnâ on the north and south. It
| bordered on Kalinga; (see Dk. 7th Ullâsa,) and
| its capital अंध्रनगर is probably the old town of
| Vengi or Vegi.

| अवंति¦ N. of a country, north of the Narmadâ; its
| capital was Ujjayinî, also called Avantipurî or
| Avanti and Vi\ *s*\ âlà, (cf. Me. 30) situated on the
| Siprâ. It is the western part of Málvâ. In the
| time of the Mahâbhârata the country extended on
| the south to the banks of the Narmadâ and on the
| west probably to the banks of the Mahi or Myhe.
| On the north of Avanti lay another principality
| with its capital Da\ *s*\ apura on the Charmanvati river,
| which appears to be the modern town of Dholpur,
| and was the capital of Rantideva.

| अश्मक¦ An old name of Travancore.

| आनर्त¦ See सौराष्ट्र।

| इंद्रप्रस्थ¦ (also called हरिप्रस्थ, शक्रप्रस्थ &c.) identified with
| the modern Delhi, though it stood on the left bank
| of the Yamunâ, while Delhi stands on the right.

| उत्कल¦ or ओड् N. of a country, the modern Orissa,
| which lay to the south of Tâmralipta, and extend-
| ed to the river Kapi\ *s*\ á; cf. R. 4. 38. The chief
| to was of this province are Cuttak and Purî where
| the celebrated temple of Jagannath is situated.

| कनखल¦ N. of a village near Hardvâra which is situat-
| ed on the Ganges at the southern base of the
| Sewalika mountains. कनखत was also the name of the
| surrounding mountains.

| कपिशा¦ See under सुह्य।

| कलिंग¦ N. of a country lying to the south of Odra or
| Orissa and extending to the mouths of the Godâ-
| varî. It is identified with the Northern Circars.
| Its capital कलिंगनगर was in ancient times at some
| distance from the sea-coast (cf. Dk. 7th Ullâsa),
| and was probably at Râjamahendri; see अंध्र also. 

| कांची¦ See under द्रविड।

| कामरूप¦ An important kingdom said to have extended
| from the banks of the Karatoyâ or Sadánîrâ to
| the extremities of Assam. It must have extended
| up to the Himâlaya on the north and the borders of
| China on the east, as its king is said to have assist-
| ed Duryodhana with an army of Kirâtas and
| Chînas. The ancient capital of this kingdom was
| प्राग्ज्योतिष on the other side of the Lauhitya or the
| river Brahmap utra; cf. R. 4. 81.

| कांबोज¦ N. of a people and their country. They
| must have inhabited the Hindoo Koosh mountain
| which separates the Giljit valley from Balkh, and
| probably extended up to little Thibet and Lâdak.
| Their country was famous for handsome horses and
| shawls made of goats', rats', and dogs' wool, and
| abounded in walnut trees; cf. R. 4. 69.

| कुंतल¦ N. of the country to the north of Chola.
| Kalyâna or Kallian Doorg south of Kurugade
| appears to have been its capital. The country re-
| presents the south-western portion of Hyderabad.

| कुरुक्षेत्र¦ N. of an extensive region or plain near Delhi;
| the scene of the great war between the Pâṇḍavas
| and Kauravas. It is the tract near the holy lake
| called by the same name lying to the south of
| Thàneshvar, and extended from the south of the
| Sarasvatî to the north of the Drishadvatî. It is
| sometimes called समंतपंचक the tract of the ‘five
| pools’ of blood of the Kshatriyas slain by
| Para\ *s*\ urâma.

| कुलूत¦ N. of a country (modern Kulu) lying to the
| north east of the Jalandar Doab and on the right
| bank of the Satadru (Sutlej).

| कुशावती¦ or कुशस्थली The capital of Dakshiṇa-Ko\ *s*\ ala
| and situated in the defiles of the Vindhya; it must
| have been to the north of the Narmadâ but south
| of the Vindhya, and is probably the same as
| Ramnagar in Bundelkhand. Ràja\ *s*\ ekhara calls the
| lord of Ku\ *s*\ asthalî मध्यदेशनरेंद्र, the lord of the mid-
| dle-land or Bundelkhand.

| केकय¦ The country of the Kekayas bordering on
| Sindhu-Desa q. v.

| केरल¦ The strip of land between the Western Ghats
| and the sea north of the Kâverî. The principal
| rivers in this tract are the Netravatî, the \ *S*\ arâvatî
| and the Kâli-Nadî, which is considered to be the 
| same as the Muralâ referred to in R. 4. 55, and
| in U. 3, and forms the principal river of Kerala.
| Kerala corresponds to modern Kânarâ, and pro-
| bably included Malabar also, and extended beyond
| the kâverî.

| कोशल¦ N. of a country situated, according to the
| Râmâyaṇa, along the banks of the Sarayū (or
| Gogrâ). It was divided into ‘Uttara-Ko\ *s*\ ala’
| and ‘Dakshiṇa Ko\ *s*\ ala.’ The former is also called
| ‘Ganda’, and it must have therefore signified the
| country north of Ayodhyâ comprising Ganda
| and Baraitch. Aja, Da\ *s*\ aratha &c. are said to have
| ruled over this province. At the time of Râma's
| death his two sons Ku\ *s*\ a and Lava reigned respec-
| tively at Kusâvatî in southern Ko\ *s*\ ala in the de-
| files of the Vindhyas, and at \ *S*\ râvastî in northern
| Ko\ *s*\ ala.

| was near the modern Kosam about 30 miles above
| Allahabad.

| कौशिकी¦ N. of a river (Ku\ *s*\ i) which flowed on the

| गौड¦ or पुंड्र Northern Bengal, (Puṇḍra originally
| signifying the land of the ‘Pooree’ cane.)

| चेदि¦ N. of a country and their people. The Chedis
| were also called Dàhalas and Traipuras; they oc-
| cupied the banks of the Narmadâ and were the
| same as the people of दशार्ण q. v. Their capital was
| at one time त्रिपुरी q. v. The Chedis are considered
| by some to have inhabited the modern Bundel-
| khand in Central India, while by others their
| country is identified with the modern Chandail.
| The Haihayas or Kalachuris ruled at Mâhishmatî
| situated on the Narmadâ between the Vindhya
| and Riksha mountains about Bheraghar below
| Jabbalpur.

| चोल¦ N. of a country, situated on the banks of the
| Kâverî and said to cover the southern portion of
| Mysore. It was beyond the Kâverî, as Puleka\ *s*\ i
| II. invaded it after crossing the river. The coun-
| try latterly came to be called Karnâṭaka.

| जनस्थान¦ ‘Human habitation’, a part of the great
| Daṇḍakâ forest which stood in the vicinity of the
| mountain called Prasravaṇa. The celebrated Pan-
| chava\ *t*\ î (identified by local tradition with the place
| of the same name situated about 2 miles from the
| present Nassik) stands in this tract.

| जालंधर¦ The modern Jalandar Doab, watered by the
| rivers \ *S*\ atadru and Vipâ\ *s*\ â (Sutlej and Beas).

| ताम्रपर्णी¦ N. of a river rising in the Malaya moun-
| tain. It appears to be the same as the Tâmbara-
| vâri of the present day which rises in the eastern
| declivity of the western Ghats, runs through the 
| district of Tinnevelly, and falls into the gulf of
| Manar; cf. R. 4. 49, 50 and B. R. 10. 56.

| ताम्रलिप्त¦ See under सुह्म।

| त्रिगर्त¦ A most arid country in ancient times. It
| stood for the desert on the east of the \ *S*\ atadru,
| and included the tract between the Sutlej and the
| Sarasvatî containing Loodiana and Pattiala on the
| north and some portion of the desert on the
| south.

| त्रिपुर-री¦ N. of the capital of the Chedis, ‘made
| noisy by the waves of the Moon's daughter’, \ *i. e.*\ 
| the Narmadâ, and, therefore, situated on that
| river. It is identified with the modern Tevur
| 6 miles from Jabbalpur.

| दशपुर¦ See under अवंति।

| दशार्ण¦ N. of a country, through which flows the
| Dasârṇâ (Dasan). It was the eastern part of
| Mâlava or Mâlvâ, its capital being Vidi\ *s*\ â--the
| modern Bhilsâ--situated on the Vetravati or Betva,
| cf. Me. 24, 25 and Kâdambarî. Kâlidása also
| makes Vidi\ *s*\ á a river which is probably the same
| as the Bees that joins the Betva.

| द्रविड¦ N. of a country to the south of the wild tract
| between the Kṛishṇâ and the Polar. In its larger
| sense it included the whole of the Coromandel
| coast to the south of the Godâvarî. But in its
| strict sense it must not have extended beyond the
| Kâverî. Its capital was Kânchî, the same as
| Conjeveram situated on the Vegavatî river 42
| miles south-west of Madras.

| द्वारका¦ See under सौराष्ट्र्।

| निषध¦ N. of a country ruled over by Nala; its capi-
| tal is said to have been Alakâ, situated on the river
| Alakanandâ. It appears to have formed part of
| the modern Kumaon in northern India. This is
| also the name of one of the Varsha mountains.

| पंचवटी¦ See under जनस्थान।

| पंचाल¦ N. of a celebrated region which lay, accord-
| ing to Râja \ *S*\ ekhara (B. R. 10. 86), between
| the streams of the Yamunâ and the Ganges,
| and is, therefore, the Gangetic Doab. In the
| time of Drupada it extended from the banks of
| the Charmanvati (Chambal) upto Gangâdvâra
| on the north. The northern portion from Bhâ-
| gîrathî was called ‘Uttara-Panchâla,’ which
| was Ahichhatra. The southern portion was cal-
| led ‘Dakshina-Panchâla,’ which was merged in
| the kingdom of Hastinâpura after the death of
| Drupada.

| पद्मपुर¦ The native place of the poet Bhavabhūti, si-
| tuated somewhere near Chandrapura or Chàndá
| in the Nâgpur districts.

| पद्मावती¦ Identified with the modern Narwâr in
| Mâlva as being situated on the river \ *Sind*\  or
| Sindhu. The other rivers, that are in its vici-
| nity, are Pârâ or Pârvatî, Luṇa, and Madhuvar
| which correspond to the Pârá, Lavaṇâ and Ma- 
| dhumatî, mentioned by Bhavabhūti, as flowing
| in the vicinity of the town. This town was the
| scene of Bhavabhūtî's Mâlati-Màdhava.

| पंपा¦ N. of a celebrated lake, which is considered to
| be the same as the river Pennair, near which
| stands the \ *R*\ ishyamūka mountain. The river is
| known to rise from tanks; the northern part espe-
| cially from a stone tank in the centre of Chander-
| doorg. This was probably the original Pampâ, and
| Chanderdoorg the \ *R*\ ishyamūka mountain. Subse-
| quently the name was transferred from the tank
| to the river which rose from it.

| पाटलिपुत्र¦ N. of an important town in Magadha or
| south Behar situated at the confluence of the
| Ganges and the \ *S*\ oṇa (or Son). It was also cal-
| led ‘Kusumapura’ or ‘Palibothra’ referred to
| in the classical accounts of India. It is said to
| have been destroyed by a river inundation about
| the middle of the eighth century A. D.

| पांड्य¦ N. of a country in the extreme south of India,
| and lying to the south-west of Cholade\ *s*\ a. The
| mountain Malaya and the river Tâmraparṇî fix
| its position indisputably; cf. B. R. 3. 31. It may
| be identified with the modern Tinnevelly. The
| holy island of Râmeshvara belonged to this king-
| dom, Kâlidása calls the capital of Pâṇḍya-de\ *s*\ a
| the ‘serpent-town’, which is probably the same as
| Negapattan 160 miles south of Madras; cf. R. 6.
| 59-64.

| पारसीक¦ The people inhabiting Persia-perhaps ap-
| plicable also to the tribes inhabiting the outly-
| ing districts on the north-western frontier.
| Horses from their country are mentioned under
| the name वनायुदेश्य।

| in India. It is probably the same as the
| Sewalik mountains which run parallel to the
| Himâlaya and guard the Gangetic Doab on the
| north-east.

| प्रतिष्ठान¦ The capital of Purūravas, one of the earliest
| kings of the lunar dynasty; situated opposite
| Prayâga or Allahabad. It is said in Harivam\ *s*\ a to
| have been situated on the north bank of the
| Ganges, in the district of Prayâga. Kàlidàsa
| places it at the junction of the Ganges and Yamuná;
| cf. V. 2.

| मगध¦ The country of the Magadhas or south Behar.
| Its old capital was गिरिव्रज (or राजगृह) which con-
| sisted of five hills विपुलगिरि, रत्नागिरि, उदयगिरि, शोणगिरि,
| and वैभार-- (or व्याहार--) गिरि। Its next capital was
| Pátaliputra q. v. Magadha was also called कीकट in
| later literature.

| मत्स्य¦ or विराट N. of a country lying to the west of
| Dholpur; the Pâṇḍavas are said to have entered it
| from the banks of the Yamuná through the land
| of the Rohitakas and Sūrasenas towards the north 
| of Da\ *s*\ ârṇa. Vairâṭa, the capital of Virâṭa, is
| probably the same as Bairat 40 miles north of
| Jeypore.

| मलय¦ One of the seven principal chains of mountains
| in India. It is most probably to be identified with
| the southern portion of the Ghàts running from
| the south of Mysore, and forming the eastern
| boundary of Travancore. It is said by Bhavabhūti
| to be encircled by the river Káverî (Mv. 5. 3,
| also R. 4. 46), and is said to teem in cardamoms,
| pepper, sandal, and betel-nut trees. In R. 4. 51
| Kâlidâsa calls the mountains Malaya and Dardura
| ‘the two breasts of the southern region.’ \ **\ 
| \ **\  is, therefore, that portion of the Ghâts,
| which forms the south-eastern boundary of My-
| sore.

| महेंद्र¦ One of the seven principal chains of mountains
| in India identified with Mahendra Màle which
| divides Ganj m from the valley of the Mahânadî
| and probably tincluded the whole of the eastern
| Ghats between the Mahânadî and Godâvarî.

| महोदय¦ (also called कान्यकुब्ज or गाधिनगर) is the same
| as the modern Kânyakubja or Kanoja, on the
| Ganges. In the seventh century it was the most
| celebrated place in India. Cf. B. R. 10. 88-89.

| मानस¦ A lake said to be situated in Hâṭaka which
| appears to be the same as Lâdak. On the north of
| Hâṭaka is Harivarsha, the country of the northern

| the annual resort of swans at the approach of the
| rains.

| वाह्लीक, वाहीक¦ A general name for the tribes inhabit-
| ing the Punjab. Their country is the modern

| and asa-fœtida.

| विदर्भ¦ The modern Beràr, a great kingdom in ancient
| times lying to the north of Kuntala and extending
| from the banks of the Kṛishṇâ to about the banks of 
| the Narmadâ. On account of its great size, the
| country was also called ‘Mahârâshṭra’; cf. B. R.
| 10. 74. Kuṇḍinapura, also called Vidarbhâ, was its
| ancient capital, which probably stands for the modern
| Beder. The river Varadâ (Warda) divided Vidar-
| bha into two parts, Amarâvatî being the capital
| of the northern, and Pratishṭhâna of the southern,
| part.

| विदिशा¦ See under दशार्ण।

| विदेह¦ N. of a country lying to the north-east of Maga-
| dha. Its capital Mithilá is the same as Janakapur
| in Nepal north of Madhuvâṇî. Videha must have
| covered, in ancient times, besides a portion of
| Nepal, all such places as Sîtâmâri, Sîtâkunda, or the
| northern part of the old district of Trihut and the
| north-western portion of Champaran.

| विराट¦ See मत्स्य।

| is said to have reigned; (it is called शरावती in R.
| 15. 97). It is identified with Sahet Mahet north
| of Ayodhyâ. It was al\ *s*\ o called धर्मपत्तन or धर्मपुरी।

| सिंधुदशेः¦ The country of the upper Indus. 

| सह्म¦ N. of a country which lay to the west of Vanga.

| लिप्ती and तमालिनी) is identified with the modern
| Tumlook on the right bank of the Cossye, which
| is the same as the कपिशा of Kâlidâsa. In ancient
| times the town was situated nearer to the sea,.
| and was a place of considerable maritime trade.
| The Suhmas are sometimes called Râḍhas, the
| people of Western Bengal.

| सौराष्ट्र¦ (also called आनर्त) The modern peninsula of

| The old Dwârakâ stood near Madhupura 95 miles
| south-east of Dwàrakâ, and also near mount Raiva-
| taka, which appears to be the same as the Girinar
| hill near Junagad. Valabhi appears to have been
| the next capital of the country, the ruins of which
| were discovered at Bilbi 10 miles north-west of
| Bhownaggar. The celebrated lake Prâbhasa was
| situated in the same country and stood on the
| sea-coast.

| स्रुघ्न¦ N. of a town and district at some distance from
| Pâtaliputra. It is identified with the modern Sug
| on the old bed of the Yamunâ.

| हेमकूट¦ The ‘golden-peaked’ mountain, one of the
| ranges of mountains which divide the known con-
| tinent into nine \ *Varshas*\  (वर्षपवर्त); it is general-
| ly supposed to be situated north of the Himâlaya
| --or between the Meru and the Himálaya-form-
| ing with it the boundaries of the \ *Kimpurusha*\ -
| \ *varsha*\  or abode of \ *Kinnaras,*\  cf K. 136. Kâlidâsa
| speaks of it as ‘having plunged into the eastern
